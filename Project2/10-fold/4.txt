Under its revised proposal, Atlanta-based BellSouth would have a 50% interest in the new cellular company and would be responsible for half of its debt. To sweeten the pact further - and to ease concerns of institutional investors - BellSouth added a provision designed to give extra protection to holders if the regional Bell company ever decides to buy the rest of the new cellular company. The provision, described as “back-end” protection, would require BellSouth to pay a price equivalent to what an outside party might have to pay.

Mr. Thompson believes the case for working together is stronger now than ever. “The cost of competition has become extremely high,” he says. “We must find ways to save money for the futures commission merchants who do business on our exchanges.” He thinks that progress in cooperation can be made in areas where no vested interests have built up. One of those areas is the development of a hand-held electronic device that would permit floor traders to enter trades as they make them. The GAO has recommended the creation of a system to record trade data so that an independent, verifiable audit trail can be established to prevent customer fraud. The Merc is now cooperating with the Comex in developing such a device to provide such an audit trail. The Chicago exchanges also are working on such a device.

Net rose to $185.1 million, or $1.55 a share, from $167.9 million, or $1.47 a share, a year earlier. The company said the gain resulted mainly from a $54 million increase in net interest income, reflecting a 33% increase in real estate loans (mainly residential), and a 19% rise in consumer loans. These high-yielding loans in effect replaced some low-yielding assets such as inter-bank loans, which were allowed to decrease. As a result, Security Pacific's net interest margin fell only 13 basis points, a more mild decrease than some major banks outside California, which have been reporting more sluggish earnings.

U.S. law requires criminal defendants to turn over foreign documents such as those sought in the Marcos case. The law is meant to overcome delays caused by defendants' use of foreign procedures to block U.S. requests for records, Judge Keenan said in his opinion.

The U.S. has charged that the Marcoses' alleged crimes involved bank accounts in the Philippines, Hong Kong, the U.S. and other countries.

The mounting risks did not go unobserved, even in the mid-1980s.

The beneficiaries were those financiers whose icon was the topic figure of '80s capitalism, Michael Milken's $517 million salary in one year.

What is the consequence of a high-interest burden, high default rates and continued low profitability? Corporations need liquidity, in the form of borrowed funds. Without liquidity from the junk-bond market or cash flow from profits, they look to the government, which obediently assists the natural motions of the capitalist economy with charity in the form of cuts in the capital-gains tax rate or bailouts. The consequence can be inflation, brought on as the effect of a desperate bid to avoid the deflationary shock of a sudden crash.

Market Order: This is probably the most widely used order - and the one most open to abuse by unscrupulous floor brokers, since it imposes no price restrictions. With a market order, an investor tells a broker to buy or sell “at the market.” It's like saying, “get me in now” or “get me out now.” For example, if wheat is being offered at $4.065 and bid at $4.060, a market order to buy would be filled at the higher price and a market order to sell at the lower price. A recent indictment alleges that some floor brokers at the two largest Chicago commodity exchanges used market orders to fill customers' orders at unfavorable prices by arranging trades with fellow brokers. Profits realized from these trades would then be shared by the conspiring brokers.

“If apartheid means you want cheap black labor and all the comforts that go with it, but you also want to exclude the blacks from social and political integration, then these are two contradictions that can't go on forever,” says Mr. Verwoerd. He is sitting in his living room, beneath a huge portrait of his late father, Hendrik F. Verwoerd, apartheid's architect and South African prime minister from 1958 to 1966. Somewhere, the son sighs, things went terribly wrong with apartheid; today, whites even rely on blacks to police their separation.

For most of the book, there is no direct connection between its urban and its Amazonian modes. But the contrast between them becomes a living thing through the brilliant contrast of narrative styles that Mr. Vargas Llosa creates. He controls this counterpoint like a novelistic Bach, reaching an audacious extreme in a hilarious chapter in which the “Vargas Llosa” voice relates his adventures as an inept television newsman. But the joke turns serious when a reportage takes him to Amazonia and he encounters the missionaries who know more than anyone else about the Machiguengas. By this point, the narrator has become obsessed with finding out about the Machiguenga storytellers, who, he had heard years before, functioned like cultural glue for a tribe split into many small bands in constant motion through the jungle. The storytellers traveled among the bands, reminding them of their identity. But why would no Machiguenga the narrator meets during his reportage even admit that there were storytellers?

Enforcers can't put charities out of business simply because they spend the lion's share of their income on fund raising. State laws previously used as a yardstick minimum percentages of income - usually half - that had to be spent on the program rather than overhead, but these have been overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. It has ruled that such laws might work to stifle fund raising, which would amount to limiting the charities' first-amendment right to freedom of expression.

But there are grounds for complaint. At one point, the reader is two steps ahead of Marlowe in catching on to a double identity scam - and Marlowe is supposed to be the pro. More bothersome, there are several apparent anachronisms. Contact lenses, tank tops, prostitutes openly working the streets of Hollywood and the Tequila Sunrise cocktail all seem out of place in the 1950s. A little more care in re-creating Marlowe's universe would have made the book that much more enjoyable.

Trompel'oeil painting is meant to fool the eye, but Robert Lawrence Trotter, 35, of Kennett Square, Pa., took his fooling seriously. He painted one himself in the style of John Haberle and sold it as a 19th-century original to antique dealers in Woodbridge, Conn. Mr. Trotter's painting showed a wall of wood boards with painted ribbons tacked down in a rectangle; tucked behind the ribbons were envelopes, folded, faded and crumpled papers and currency. Mr. Trotter's fake Haberle was offered at a bargain price of $25,000 with a phony story that it belonged to his wife's late aunt in New Canaan, Conn.

In announcing the results, USAir cited many of the same problems that several other industry officials have named recently. It said the industry's domestic traffic was flat in the third quarter; analysts say this was because hefty fare increases earlier in the year scared off many leisure travelers this summer. To try to combat the traffic slowdown, airlines started reducing fares; average fares rose only 1.7% in August, in contrast to increases of 16% each in February and March. But so far, the effort has failed, and traffic is still slow.

Psyllium is an annual herb, Plantago ovata, that has been used for centuries by folk doctors here, mainly as a laxative and anti-diarrheal. As such, the soluble fiber has an almost fanatic following in northern India. “I can assure you,” attests a 25-year-old lawyer in New Delhi, with a meaningfully raised eyebrow, “from personal experience, it works.” A prominent businessman in Bombay gives a similar testimonial: “I have been taking it daily since 1961.” Folk doctors also prescribe it for kidney, bladder and urethra problems, duodenal ulcers and hemorrhoids. Some apply it to gouty joints.

Beyond that, many big oil, chemical and airline companies are siphoning off big chunks of the market by insuring themselves through “captive” offshore companies for industry-specific coverage.

The first of three major sources of error is the use of labor input estimates (mainly employment or hours) instead of output estimates for those sectors, such as governments, paid household services and private non-profit institutions, where there are difficulties in assembling output data. This means that no allowance is made for possible increases in output per unit of labor. In an unrelated program in which the Labor Department does estimate output per employee for more than two-thirds of federal civilian employees, it found an average annual rate of productivity improvement of 1.7% during the 1980s. Even if it is assumed that productivity rose no more than half as quickly in the rest of the nonbusiness sector, this Labor Department estimate indicates a downward bias in the real GNP estimates of 0.2 percentage point a year, on average.

What makes the veteran FBI man so endearing is his hard-bitten cynicism - earned, we discover, when he was assigned to the civil rights movement back in the 1960s.

This is not the “Mississippi Burning” scenario that thrills his young colleagues: “Kid, you've been reading Classic Comics too long,” Mancuso says. “Back in 1964, the FBI had five black agents.

We're sorry to see Nigel Lawson's departure from the British government. He is a politician with the courage of true conviction, as in summarily sacking exchange controls and in particular slashing the top rate of income taxation to 40%. But in the end his resignation as Chancellor of the Exchequer may be a good thing, especially if it works as he no doubt intends - by forcing Prime Minister Thatcher and her counterparts elsewhere to confront the genuine intellectual issues involved.

Sources familiar with the transaction say officials at some Rockefeller units are unhappy with the deal. Managers of Rockefeller's Cushman & Wakefield Inc., a national real estate brokerage, have reportedly structured a company buy-out plan which was rejected by its parent. Cushman President Arthur J. Mirante II had no comment on reports of the buy-out effort or the Mitsubishi acquisition. But the sources say Rockefeller was seeking at least $200 million for the real estate services firm, a price that would make a buy-out impractical for the managers. Cushman's management is made up of top brokers who are considered the firm's major asset and whose cooperation is regarded as vital to its success. Sources estimate Cushman will have 1989 revenue of more than $275 million.

Despite a decade-long attempt to revamp the socialist economy, China's mega-welfare state is alive and well. Health care is free, housing costs just pennies and food is heavily subsidized. At Panzhihua, as in other big state-run factories, workers still can count on a cradle-to-grave safety net. Factory officials estimate that more than 10% of the work force here is redundant, but layoffs aren't allowed. Even factory workers' children are guaranteed jobs. The industrial monoliths are so deeply involved in the welfare system that China's leaders may never be able to modernize them, despite their glaring economic inefficiency. Though the Panzhihua factory itself is profitable, many such enterprises aren't. Subsidies for money-losing enterprises totaled $18 billion last year, or about one-third the total state revenue.

Many economists contend that deep cuts in the U.S. budget deficit are needed before further trade improvement can occur. That's because the budget deficit feeds an enormous appetite in this country for both foreign goods and foreign capital, overwhelming the nation's capacity to export. “People are sick and tired of hearing about these deficits, but the imbalances are still there and they are still a problem,” said Mr. Robertson.

Excision of appropriations riders that trespass on the president's duties and prerogative under Article II would be different from the line-item veto. As discussed in the context of controlling federal spending, the line-item veto is characterized as a way for the president to excise perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that are objectionable merely because they conflict with his policy objectives. The excision of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited applicability. One could argue that it is not an assertion of a item veto at all for the president, by exerting a power of excision, to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers.

The researchers say many Japanese companies err in the U.S. by adopting the American practice of hiring managers on the “open market.” In Japan, by contrast, companies tend to develop their own talent and promote from within.

UNR recently emerged from bankruptcy-law proceedings that left 64% of the reorganized company's common stock in the hands of trustees of an asbestos-disease claims trust. The company said it would have no further comment. Mr. Leavitt, 37, was elected chairman earlier this year by the company's new board, having served as vice president for legal and corporate affairs. His father, David S. Leavitt, was chairman and chief executive until his death in an accident five years ago, at which time Mr. Penn was named president.

Anyway, the A's gave you a lot of heroes to root for. In the opening game, besides Steinbach and Stewart, there was Walt Weiss, a twiggy-looking, second-year shortstop who had lost a couple months of the season to knee surgery. He was flawless afield (ditto in game two), moved a runner along in the A's three-run second inning, and homered for his team's final tally. Such is his reputation among the East Bay Bashers that when he hit his first career home run last season, the fan who caught it agreed to turn the ball over to him in return for an autograph.

Sen. Bradley's argument is that a capital-gains tax cut would be bad for the economy in the longer run. It would inevitably lead to an increase in marginal income-tax rates in 1990, he thinks, when the White House is forced to ask for higher taxes to meet budget targets. That is, with capital gains cut, the glue of the 1986 accord will be gone, and political realities will push up income-tax rates. The counter-argument, which he has heard, is that if he and his fellow Democrats are successful in killing the president's proposal, the revenue gap will open up tremendously in 1990 because of the weakened economy. In this atmosphere, there would be no serious consideration of tax increases. If Sen. Bradley would permit a vote on capital gains, though, it would pass, Christmas retail sales would be strong instead of burdened by a falling stock market, the 1990 economy would be robust, and the revenue gains at every level of government, including New Jersey's, would be surprisingly high. No tax increases would be necessary.

One thing that makes E-mail difficult to sift through is that each item looks the same.

That's Chandler's setup. Mr. Parker spins it into a pretty satisfying tale involving Poodle Springs high life, Hollywood low life and various folk who hang their hats in both worlds.

But NAHB support for subsidies is not related to the current housing crunch; over the years the NAHB has backed a host of public programs.

“Snoozing” through the Beijing massacre? This is the buzzword Adi Ignatius chooses to characterize in his review of my book “Tiananmen Diary: Thirteen Days in June” (Leisire & Arts, Sept. 8).

Mr. Florio savors this vindication, but at age 52, the congressman is also a product of his times and losses. He speaks for the death penalty as if reading from Exodus 21; to increase state revenue he focuses not on “taxes” but on “audits” to cut waste. Hard-hitting consultants match ads with Mr. Courter's team, and Mr. Florio retools himself as the lean, mean Democratic fighting machine of the 1990s. Appealing to a young audience, he scraps an old reference to Ozzie and Harriet and instead quotes the Grateful Dead. The lyric chosen - “long strange night” - may be an apt footnote to television spots by both candidates intended to portray each other as a liar.

All year, energy prices have skewed the producer price index, which measures changes in the prices producers receive for goods. Inflation unquestionably has fallen back from its torrid pace last winter, when a steep run-up in world oil prices sent the index surging at double-digit annual rates. Energy prices then plummeted through the summer, causing the index to decline for three consecutive months.

The company said its third-quarter results reflected the recent sharp climb in UAL stock to $282 a share as of Sept. 29, sparked by bids from Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis and a labor-management buy-out group. UAL's board approved the labor-management bid Sept. 14. But the bid collapsed two weeks ago, and the stock has dropped sharply since. Thus, UAL said it expects to reverse most of the stock appreciation expenses in the fourth quarter.

Old Environmentalism involved microbe hunters and sanitationists. It started with improvements in hygiene made possible by affordable soap and washable underwear during the Industrial Revolution. Then cast-iron sewer pipe and the flush toilet were followed by sewage - and water-treatment plants toward the end of the 19th century. Medicine in the 19th century was dedicated mostly to combating sepsis and diagnostic analysis. Then the 20th century saw the evolution of private-sector wonder drugs, which promulgated medical therapy. The process dramatically increased our average life expectancy, eliminated much pain and constantly improved health and well-being. Most public-health measures were handled at the local level.

But Sen. Mitchell, buoyed by his victory among fellow Democrats, strongly disagreed. Mr. Mitchell has been predicting that the president's initiative would fail this year. Yesterday, in an interview, he added that the Democrats' decision “increases the likelihood that a capital-gains tax cut will not pass this year.” Mr. Mitchell's first victory came last week, when the Senate passed a deficit-reduction bill that didn't contain a capital-gains provision. That vote made it unlikely that a capital-gains tax cut would be included in the final bill, now being drafted by House and Senate negotiators. The House version of the bill does include the tax cut.

In January 1989, the two men acquired the non-packaging assets of Triangle, including a controlling stake in Avery and, by extension, Uniroyal Chemical.

Sales fell 1.2% to $190.1 million from $192.5 million. The Murray Hill, N.J., company said full-year earnings may be off 33 cents a share because the company removed a catheter from the market. In 1988, the company earned $1.38 a share.

The common proposals for reforming the Fed would only make the situation worse, if they had any effect at all. Putting the Secretary of the Treasury on the Board of Governors, one of the leading proposals today, is an example. The secretary is the world's biggest borrower of money. He has a built-in, constant longing for lower interest rates. Moreover, he is a political agent of a political president, who naturally gives extraordinary weight to the way the economy will perform before the next election, and less to its longer-run health. These days, the secretary suffers the further disqualification that he is a member of a club of seven finance ministers who meet occasionally to decide what exchange rates should be, which is a diversion from the real business of the Federal Reserve to stabilize the price level.

Unlike the earlier U.S. farm-trade proposal which struck European countries as too extreme, the latest plan would provide some room for maneuver. For instance, the new U.S. package makes clear there would be a transition period during which GATT members could use a combination of tariffs and quotas to cushion their farmers from foreign competition. It also says countries could temporarily raise tariffs on certain products if they experience an unusually heavy volume of imports.

To the extent that Friday's sell-off reflected a sudden reappraisal of the excesses of leverage, the message is that Wall Street and the private markets are fully capable of imposing the appropriate incentives and sanctions on corporate behavior. The national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of various LBO deals and leveraged restructurings. The recent difficulties in the junk-bond markets and the scarcity of bank capital for recent deals underscores the wisdom of letting the free markets operate.

The symptoms all point to one thing: Japan does not have a modern government. Its government still wants to sit in the driver's seat, set the speed, step on the gas, apply the brakes and steer, with 120 million people in the back seat. In a modern system, the government's role is to give the people as much choice as possible and to keep them well informed so they are capable of making a choice.

The new, seven-year funds - one offering a fixed-rate return and the other with a floating-rate return linked to the London interbank offered rate - offer two key advantages to Japanese investors. First, they are designed to eliminate the risk of prepayment - mortgage-backed securities can be retired early if interest rates decline, and such prepayment forces investors to redeploy their money at lower rates. Second, they channel monthly mortgage payments into semiannual payments, reducing the administrative burden on investors.

The city's recovery from the earthquake was uneven. Banks indicated they were operating at greater than 90% of their usual capacity, but a Nob Hill hotel said tourists had fled, leaving the previously full hotel with an 80% vacancy rate. City crews tallied the wreckage to buildings, but lacked a clear sense of how gravely transportation arteries were disabled. Among the city's banks, Bank of America said all but eight of its 850 branches were open. The closed branches, in San Francisco, Hayward, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz, sustained structural damage. Power failures kept just seven of its 1,500 automated-teller machines off-line. Securities-trading operations were moved to Bank of America's Concord office, and foreign-exchange trading operations were shifted to Los Angeles, the bank said.

With investment banking as Kidder's “lead business,” where do Kidder's 42-branch brokerage network and its 1,400 brokers fit in? Mr. Carpenter this month sold off Kidder's eight brokerage offices in Florida and Puerto Rico to Merrill Lynch & Co., refueling speculation that Kidder is getting out of the brokerage business entirely. Mr. Carpenter denies the speculation. To answer the brokerage question, Kidder, in typical fashion, completed a task-force study. The result: Kidder will focus on rich individual investors and small companies, much closer to the clientele of Goldman, Sachs & Co. than a serve-the-world firm like Merrill Lynch or Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. Mr. Carpenter notes that these types of investors also are “sophisticated” enough not to complain about Kidder's aggressive use of program trading.

Maybe we should ask why it was that Du Pont so quickly capitulated and issued a statement, giving it wide publicity, that it was withdrawing CFCs. Freon, introduced in 1930, revolutionized America by making refrigeration and air conditioning practical after all. One answer is that big companies are growing weary of fighting environmental movements and are trying instead to cash in on them, although they never care to put it quite that way. Du Pont, as it happens, has a potential substitute for CFCs. Imperial Chemical Industries of the U.K. also has one, and is building a plant in Louisiana to produce it. Japanese chemical companies are at work developing their own substitutes and hoping to conquer new markets, of course.

The Fuji, to be sure, has blemishes too. It ripens later than most apples, and growing it in U.S. areas with chilly autumns may be tricky. Moreover, the frumpy Fuji must compete with an increasingly dolledup Delicious. Mr. Broderick, the Massachusetts grower, says the “big boss” at a supermarket chain even rejected his Red Delicious recently because they weren't waxed and brushed for extra shine. And he hadn't used hormones, which many growers employ to elongate their Delicious apples for greater eye appeal. Still, Mr. Auvil points out, Grannies became popular without big, red looks, so why not Fujis? He sees a shift in American values - at least regarding apples - toward more emphasis on substance and less on glitz. “Taste has finally come to the fore,” he says. Or, for that matter, the core.

Former Patterson, N.J., principal Joe Clark was no doubt the general public's first experience with this new breed of no-nonsense administrator. The subject of the movie “Lean on Me,” Mr. Clark controlled his school with a bullhorn and a baseball bat. He may have gone overboard in his pursuit of good discipline, but isn't it interesting that some of the country's biggest, most troubled school districts are choosing new chiefs from the same gravel-chewing mold? Elena Scambio, the woman assigned to run the Jersey City school system that was taken over by the state, says her top priority will be to “cut through the dead hand of bureaucracy.”

Many investors say the circuit breakers, instituted following the 1987 collapse, provided little reassurance. One Big Board specialist complains that the Friday futures halt, which was supposed to give the markets time to regain their equilibrium because futures prices are reported faster, was “ridiculous; anything artificial that gets in the way of this market is very hard to work with.” Some traders fear circuit breakers hold the risk of making matters worse, especially if they should halt stock trading. But Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. maintains that the safeguards were a success Friday.

Put another way, the decline in the yield suggests stocks have gotten pretty rich in price relative to the dividends they pay, some market analysts say.

Under bankruptcy law, Eastern has exclusive rights for a certain period to develop its own reorganization plan. That deadline has been extended once and could be extended again. If Eastern can get creditor support, court confirmation of its plan could be relatively swift. But creditors are free to press for court approval of their own plan, or the court could ignore both sides and draw its own. In any event, some people familiar with the case question whether the court will act by January as forecast by Mr. Lorenzo and Mr. Bakes. Eastern sought bankruptcy-law protection a few days after a crippling strike began March 4.

Mr. Ridley's decision fires the starting pistol for perhaps a costly contest between the world's auto giants for Britain's leading luxury-car maker.

GM has been negotiating a friendly transaction with Jaguar that likely would involve joint ventures and an eventual stake of just under 30%.

That acquisition, to be completed by year end, will include the Cover Girl and Clarion makeup lines, making P&G the top marketer of cosmetics in mass-market outlets.

Francoise Verne, 52-year-old former deputy director of France's mint, faces prison for her theft of some 67 rare coins from the mint's collections. Second in command from 1979 to 1984, Mrs. Verne told a Paris court that the “great disorder” that reigned at the agency led her into temptation. Before an inventory in 1984 that showed the “disappearance” of 944 coins valued at about 2.9 million French francs (about $465,000), there hadn't been any stock-taking since 1868. Tony Lambert, Mrs. Verne's successor, says the mint's losses from the theft run into the hundreds of thousands of francs.

The plastic will be sent to a plant in Leominster, Mass., near Boston, which is owned by a joint venture recently formed by plastics makers.

Another analyst, John C.

People are reading the boxes and deciding they want something that's “healthy” for you - oats, bran.” Mr. Maxwell said he wouldn't be surprised if, over the next two years or so, General Mills' share increased to 30% or more.

Moody's Investors Service said it reduced its rating on $165 million of subordinated debt of this Beverly Hills, Calif., thrift, citing turmoil in the market for low-grade, high-yield securities. The agency said it reduced its rating on the thrift's subordinated debt to B-2 from Ba-2 and will keep the debt under review for possible further downgrade. Columbia Savings is a major holder of so-called junk bonds. New federal legislation requires that all thrifts divest themselves of such speculative securities over a period of years.

We should also concede that in the British experience the monetarist cause regains some of the credibility it lost in the U.S. experience. Nearby Paul Craig Roberts, a distinguished supply-sider with monetarist sympathies, argues the case for Sir Alan. Perhaps the fiscal shock of tax cuts is after all best absorbed by floating rates, though of course in the event Mr. Lawson resigned over whether to support a weak pound, not restrain a strong one. We recall that Mr. Roberts not only chides the Chancellor for being too easy because of a desire to constrain sterling, but also led the chorus saying that Mr. Volcker was too tight when he let the dollar rise. Somewhere in between there must be a golden mean, perhaps measured by M-Whatever, but perhaps measured by purchasing power parity.

Like so many trends in the entertainment industry, the current spate of rape dramas on television seems to represent a confluence of high-mindedness and self-interest. The former comes from the latest wave of political activism in Hollywood, especially around feminist issues such as abortion.

The Tax Court recently denied business deductions by Mr. and Mrs. Peter S. Rubin of Cherry Hill, N.J., who both were part-time distributors of Amway products in addition to their regular jobs as sales people in other fields. For 1984, they reported gross income of $1,647 from Amway sales, offset by expenses totaling $16,746 - including car costs of $6,805 and travel and entertainment costs of $5,088. The Tax Court didn't believe that the Rubins, who earned $65,619 in their regular jobs, treated the sideline as a real business and derived “merely incidental elements of recreation and other personal pleasure and benefits” from it.

Because of program trading it is more difficult to trade many OTC stocks without sharp price moves, a condition known as illiquidity.

It's a downbeat, “thirtysomething” world, in which bright, still youngish people are engaged in a glossy version of day labor, doing free-lance, semi-professional work that brings little satisfaction or security but that they know they should be grateful to do. Uncertainty dogs every aspect of their lives. Malcolm faces bankruptcy and an IRS audit, but Nora finds an extra $30,000 in her bank account, suddenly increasing her available funds some fifteenfold. While she is wondering whether to live it up, and do something even more dramatic, say get married, her life is further complicated by the reappearance of an old flame, David, a film critic and actor who always seems to be just on the brink of stardom.

But under Jerry Perry's direction the current Steppenwolf production, scheduled to play through Nov. 19, breaks through the flat and boring ritual that “The Homecoming” had become. Led by a near-perfect performance by Alan Wilder as Max, the father, the play is at once an appalling and hilarious dissection of a family's rage, bitterness, fear and isolation. Encouraged by Mr. Wilder's sly grins, embarrassed grimaces and sputtering rages, the audience gets the joke and begins to laugh before the end of the first act.

A main motive is hard cash.

These securities are attractive to Japanese investors for three reasons. First, they are safe. While they aren't backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, as Treasury bonds are, it is widely assumed that the government would support them if necessary. (U.S. Treasury bonds are still the dollar-denominated investment of choice for long-term Japanese investors). Second, they are liquid. The secondary market in federally backed mortgage securities now exceeds $900 billion, or nearly half of the $2.2 trillion in U.S. residential mortgages issued. Third, they offer high yields. At the moment, some offer as much as 1.6 to 1.8 percentage points over Treasury securities of similar maturities.

Finally, the official estimates understate growth because they make inadequate allowance for improvements in quality of goods and services. In 1985, a new price index for computers adjusted for changes in performance characteristics was introduced, and that resulted in a significantly larger increase in real outlays for durable goods than the earlier estimates had showed. Since then, further research argues that failure to take account of quality improvements has contributed a total of at least 0.26 percentage point to the downward bias in the growth rate.

Ms. Stevens's involvement with “Baker Boys” was the result of a long affiliation with the movie's composer, Dave Grusin. “I had written lyrics with him and had sung for him in various films and contracted voices for him,” she said. “He knew my work and he called. It was really funny. When you approach a singer and tell her you don't want her to sing you always run the risk of offending. He said, “I don't know if this is going to be a compliment or an insult but ...” Then he explained that Michelle was going to do this film and the role she was playing was that of a singer and they wanted very much for her to do her own singing if that was possible.” At that point nobody, including Ms. Pfeiffer herself, was certain it would be possible.

Fill-Or-Kill Order: The fill-or-kill order is one of several associated with the timing of trades. It instructs a broker to buy or sell an investment at the specified price or better. But if the investment can't be bought or sold immediately, the order is automatically canceled. Gregory Bessemer, who came in second in the stock division of the recently completed U.S. Trading Championship, says he uses fill-or-kill orders almost exclusively when trading options. “I like to use them to feel out the market,” he says. “If they don't fill it immediately, then I can start over at a new price or try again with the same price.”

The subject of this discussion is non-violent civil disobedience; but, before we get on with that, let me make just a few tangential remarks about lawful demonstrations. They are useful to call public attention to grievances, but they have little value in educating anyone about the issues in dispute. The delight of television in dramatic confrontation encourages overuse of slogans chanted through bullhorns, militant gestures, accusatory signs and other emotionally inspired tactics. Civilized discourse and an environment where compromise can begin are lost in a hostile posture abetted by superficial media interviews.

But except for the embarrassment, British Air will emerge relatively unscathed from the flopped issue. Underwriters led by Lazard Brothers & Co. will pick up the rest of the airline's offer of four convertible capital bonds for every nine common shares. Lazard and other primary underwriters have reduced or eliminated their exposure by sub-underwriting the issue among U.K. institutional investors. “The (paper) loss here is very small” for these sub-underwriters, observed John Nelson, a Lazard managing director. In any case, he added, “most institutions probably won't sell” the bonds. And instead of buying the UAL stake, the U.K. carrier will be able to reduce its high debt level and build an acquisition war chest. “From a cash flow point of view, British Airways is better off not being in United Airlines in the short term,” said Andy Chambers, an analyst at Nomura Research Institute in London. Added another U.K. analyst: “It gives them some cash in the back pocket for when they want to do something.”

While recent events may cool some of the leveraged buy-out fever, Japanese banks aren't likely to walk away from the game.

The new technologies are intended to retire the cathode-ray tube, which accounts for most of the bulk of the conventional TV set. Replacing the cathode-ray tube with a large, thin screen is the key to the creation of a high-definition television, or HDTV, which is expected to become a $30 billion business world-wide within a decade. Large U.S. companies are interested in other segments of the HDTV business, such as signal-processing and broadcast equipment. But except for Zenith Electronics Corp. and International Business Machines Corp., which is collaborating with Toshiba on computer displays, they are poorly positioned to exploit advances in large panels. General Electric Co. recently sold off its interests in liquid-crystal displays to Thompson-CSF of France. “We found the market not developing as we thought it would,” a GE spokesman says.

Index arbitrage is a common form of program trading. As usually practiced it takes advantage of a rather basic concept: Two separate markets in different locations, trading basically the same widgets, can't trade them for long at prices that are widely different. In index arbitrage, the widget is the S&P 500, and its price is constantly compared between the futures market in Chicago and the stock markets largely in New York. To profit from an index-arbitrage opportunity, someone who owns the S&P 500 widget in New York must sell it and replace it with a cheaper S&P 500 widget in Chicago.

Production of full-sized vans will be consolidated into a single plant in Flint, Mich.

But prosecutorial guidelines are effective only if someone at Justice is willing and able to supervise hyperactive prosecutors. Judge Sentelle, of the appeals court in Washington, made this point at a Cato Institute conference last week in a remarkable speech titled, “RICO: The Monster That Ate Jurisprudence.” He said ours is supposed to be “a government of laws not of men,” and yet RICO defenders “tell us that we should rely on prosecutorial discretion to protect against overbreadth of RICO.” No prosecutorial guidelines, observed or unobserved, limit civil RICO cases by plaintiffs for damages.

The figures exclude lump-sum payments and cost-of-living adjustments, so the actual wage increases may have been bigger.

The ritzy world of department-store cosmetics retailing, where Unilever is concentrating its efforts, may prove even more treacherous. In this niche, makeup colors change seasonally because they are linked to ready-to-wear fashions. Because brand loyalty is weak and most cosmetics purchases are unplanned, careful training of store sales staffs by cosmetics companies is important. And cultivating a luxury image strong enough to persuade consumers to pay more than $15 for lipstick or eye makeup requires a subtle touch that packaged-goods companies have yet to demonstrate on their own.

Last Friday the 13th (as well as two years ago this week) the markets became unlinked. When that happened, “seismic” tremors of fear - much like the shock waves created by an earthquake - coursed through the market and increased the market's volatility. Lack of important, needed information can cause fear. Fear is the father of panic. Panic frequently results in irrational behavior. And in financial markets, irrational behavior is sometimes translated into catastrophe.

Mr. Utsumi said the most the ministry had ever done was ask Japanese banks about “the status of their participation” in one previous U.S. leveraged buy-out.

All of this is what history will note, assuming that events don't make it seem a bad joke, when the record of this time is put down.

As a U.S.-based company, Blue Arrow would have to amortize the good will over as many as 40 years, creating a continuing drag on reported earnings.

Many factors besides a dread of 1997 will have a bearing on Hong Kong's economy. One concerns Japanese investors. Barely visible on Hong Kong's property scene in 1985, by last year Japan had become the top foreign investor, spending $602 million. The market has grown relatively quiet since the China crisis. But if the Japanese return in force, their financial might could compensate to some extent for local investors' waning commitment.

After eight moves by each side, the board was the same as in a game in which Nigel Short of Great Britain fought the champion to a draw in 1980. But the computer didn't play Mr. Short's ninth move, a key pawn thrust, and its position deteriorated rapidly. Instead of castling, a standard measure to safeguard the king, D.T. made a second-rate rook maneuver at move 13; then it put a knight offside on move 16. “Only two classes of minds would think of this - very weak human players, and computers,” said Edmar Mednis, the expert commentator for the match, which was attended by hundreds of chess fans.

Beatrice Co. - $251 million of notes, due Nov. 1, 1997, was priced in a two-part offering through underwriters at Salomon Brothers Inc. The size of the issue was scaled back from an originally planned $350 million. The first part, consisting of $151 million of 13 3\/4% senior subordinated reset notes, was priced at 99.75. The rate on the notes will be reset annually to give the issue a market value of 101. However, the maximum coupon at which the notes can be reset is 16 1\/4%. The minimum coupon is 13 3\/4%. The second part, consisting of $100 million of senior subordinated floating-rate notes, was priced at 99 3\/4 to float 4.25% above the three-month London interbank offered rate. The initial coupon on the floating-rate notes will be 12.9375%. The issue is rated single-B-3 by Moody's and single-B-plus by S&P.

Despite many doubts about his candidacy, white New Yorkers - who gave Mr. Dinkins 30% of their votes in the primary - aren't expected to desert in sufficient numbers to turn the election to Mr. Giuliani.

Little chance that Shane Longman is going to recoup today. Traders spend the morning frantically selling bonds, in the belief that the U.S. monthly trade figures will look lousy. Ah, perfidious Columbia! The trade figures turn out well, and all those recently unloaded bonds spurt in price. So much for anticipating the market by a fraction of a second. And a large slice of the first episode is devoted to efforts to get rid of some nearly worthless Japanese bonds (since when is anything Japanese nearly worthless nowadays?). Surprisingly, Shane Longman survives the week, only to have a senior executive innocently bumble his way into becoming the target of a criminal insider trading investigation. Instead of closing ranks to protect the firm's reputation, the executive's internal rivals, led by a loutish American, demand his resignation. The plot is thwarted when the firm's major stockholder, kelp farming on the other side of the globe, hurries home to support the executive. But the investigation continues.

The move is consistent with a trend for corporate legal staffs to do more work in-house, instead of farming it out to law firms. Mr. Pearce set up GM's first in-house litigation group in May with four lawyers, all former assistant U.S. attorneys with extensive trial experience. He intends to add to the litigation staff. Among the types of cases the in-house litigators handle are disputes involving companies doing business with GM and product-related actions, including one in which a driver is suing GM for damages resulting from an accident.

While advertisers have long appealed to Texans' state pride and prejudices, the latest trend has been sparked, in part, by the state's recent hard economic times. That has taken some of the swagger out of natives who like to brag that Texas is the only state that was once a nation, but it has increased their legendary resentment of outsiders. In the past, writes Houston Chronicle columnist Jim Barlow, outlanders were accepted only after passing a series of tests to prove they had the “right” Texas attitudes and “of course they had to be dipped for parasites.”

Mr. Jeancourt-Galignani refused to say whether Indosuez will bid for all of Morgan Grenfell when its year is up.

Triggering the re-examination is a recent city council decision to give preference in letting city contracts to suppliers with a stated policy on child care for their employees. The preferential treatment even applies to awarding small contracts under $25,000 and consulting and temporary services - which often go to the smaller concerns. Firms are permitted wide flexibility in the child-care arrangements they provide. Council member Joy Picus, the measure's chief advocate, considers it part of a “pro-family policy” that makes Los Angeles a leader in “humanizing the workplace.”

Since the budget measures cash flow, a new $1 direct loan is treated as a $1 expenditure, even though at least part of the loan will be paid back. Loan guarantees don't appear at all until the borrower defaults, so new guarantees do not raise the deficit, even though they create future liabilities for the government. By converting an expenditure or loan to a guarantee, the government can ensure the same flow of resources and reduce the current deficit. Predictably, guarantees outstanding have risen by $130 billion since 1985, while direct loans outstanding have fallen by $30 billion.

The purchase of Nekoosa would easily eclipse Georgia-Pacific's $530 million acquisition of Brunswick Pulp & Paper Co. last year.

The book revolves around John Mariotta, the founder of the company, and Fred Neuberger, who became his partner soon after Wedtech's creation. Although started in 1965, Wedtech didn't really get rolling until 1975, when Mr. Neuberger discovered the federal government's Section 8 (A) minority business program. This is a Johnson-era, Great Society creation that mandates certain government contracts be awarded noncompetitively to minority businesses. Mr. Neuberger realized that, although of Italian ancestry, Mr. Mariotta still could qualify as a minority person since he was born in Puerto Rico. The two partners merely had to falsify the true ownership of the corporation. Instead of 50\/50 it became, on paper only, two-thirds Mariotta, one-third Neuberger, and they were in the program and off to the races.

The Japanese government doesn't allow this. The Ministry of Agriculture and Fishery actually is a ministry for farmers and fishermen instead of a ministry of provisions.

Some traders complained that OTC market makers are becoming more risk-averse because of the recent volatility. Tony Cecin, managing director of equity trading at Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood in Minneapolis, said the overall OTC market is drifting lower in part because “nobody has the nerve to make a bid for anything,” he said. Mostly in response to news from bellwether Compaq Computer, the OTC market's technology stocks were battered all day. Compaq's quarterly earnings were at the low end of analysts' forecasts, and the company said it is experiencing problems with a new microchip from Intel. Intel confirmed the Compaq report, but said the problems aren't expected to affect most users, except in “certain scientific applications.” Intel said it has more than 200 customers using the chip.

Selling a call option gives an investor a small buffer against a stock-market decline. That's because it reduces the cost of the stock by the amount of premium received from the sale of the call. But if the price of the stock rises above the strike price of the option, the stock is almost certain to be called away. And in that case, the investor misses out on any major upside gain. These calculations exclude the effect of commissions paid and dividends received from the stock. All prices are as of Monday's close.

Is there any empirical support for this theory? Three pieces of evidence corroborate the key assumption that Democratic legislators are more willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Republican colleagues. First, economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo find that GOP senators turn back roughly 10% more of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do. To the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local benefit-seeking, this indicates that political philosophy leads congressional Republicans to pay less attention to narrow constituent concerns.

This is clearly not good news to all you people who sleep like babies every night, lulled by visions of your money sitting risk-free in six-month CDs.

U.S. Treasury bonds, for example, are supersafe when it comes to returning money at maturity. But their value as investments can be decimated by inflation, which erodes the purchasing power of bonds' fixed-dollar interest payments.

The problem is one that East Germany shares with other half-states, such as North Korea, but one it must shoulder alone in the East Bloc. When Poland moves to reform, it can at least lean on its past: However flawed and short-lived Joseph Pilsudski's interwar republic, it was a nonsocialist democracy. Czech reformers can recall the Wilsonian ideals of the same period in their country. Even the Soviet Union has Peter the Great to rediscover, should it choose to. But East Germany is merely “the land of truly existing socialism.” Beyond that, it has to compete with West Germany for a claim to the German identity. Up to now, the main weapon of the “worker and peasant state” has been the ideology of socialism.

Japan imports about 50% of the logs exported from the state, which is on the island of Borneo. The call came as the council of the International Tropical Timber Organization opened a nine-day session in the Japanese city of Yokohama. Dr. Mikhail Kavanagh, an official of the World Wide Fund for Nature, said that “anything that the Japanese can do to influence the trade is going to come straight back in to influence how the forests are managed.” He urged Japan to reduce “wasteful use of tropical timbers,” such as disposable chopsticks.

“Wedding Song” gives glimpses of a Cairo that has become so much harsher since his youth, when, as he once said, “the poorest person was able to find his daily bread and without great difficulty.” The clutter of the 1940s remains, but its color has drained away, and the will to overcome has been defeated. Cars can't move because of overflowing sewers. Characters complain ceaselessly about food queues, prices and corruption. And the ubiquitous opium addict is now a cynical and selfish man who gripes: “Only government ministers can afford it these days!” Having lost their faith in God, in social reform and in opium, Cairenes are left with nothing but their sense of humor.

And the egg producers have done a pretty good job. They tried to put Mr. Maynard out of business by an act of Congress.

First, addressing the Oct. 13 market break, this was certainly more of a technical gyration and a local jungle exercise, than an investor reaction to the day's political events in Washington. Look not to the managers of taxable investment funds as the source of selling late that afternoon, but rather to several of the usual suspects (“investment” banks and institutions) geared up with imperfect trading programs that accelerate market deterioration, once begun. The catalyst for this decline was, indeed, the breakdown of the United Airlines transaction and its resultant pre-margin call liquidation of various holdings by arbitragers and other traders. I can assure Mr. Wanniski that the market is not as politically motivated as he is.

That would be comforting to fixed-income investors, many of whom were badly burned in the third quarter by incorrectly assuming that the Fed would ease. Investors rushed to buy bonds during the summer as prices soared on speculation that interest rates would continue to fall. But when it became clear that rates had stabilized and that the Fed's credit-easing policy was on hold, bond yields jumped and prices tumbled. Long-term bonds have performed erratically this year. For example, a group of long-term Treasury bonds tracked by Merrill Lynch & Co. produced a total return of 1% in the first quarter, 12.45% in the second quarter and -0.06% in the third quarter. Total return is price changes plus interest income.

Chancellor Kohl, meanwhile, has invited Mr. Krenz to open discussions with Bonn on a wide range of subjects. Reports in the West German press, citing sources in East Germany, suggest Mr. Krenz may serve only as a bridge between Mr. Honecker and a genuine reform leader. Adding to that speculation is Mr. Krenz's reputation as a heavy drinker, who is said to also suffer from diabetes. “This is a dynamic process and we're experiencing the first step,” the Bonn official adds. The selection of Mr. Krenz may also disappoint Moscow. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has pressed hard for a change in East Germany's rigid stance. Two reform-minded party leaders favored by Moscow as possible successors to Mr. Honecker, Dresden party secretary Hans Modrow and Politburo member Guenter Schabowski, were passed over. If Mr. Krenz sticks to rigid policies the pressure from the Soviet Union could intensify.

Many Japanese companies have taken the warnings by the country's leaders to heart and sought development partnerships rather than landmark properties.

Others wonder how many more of these shocks the small investor can stand. “We all assumed October '87 was a one-time shot,” said San Francisco attorney David Greenberg. “We told the little guy it could only happen once in a lifetime, come on back. Now it's happening again.” Mr. Greenberg got out just before the 1987 crash and, to his regret, never went back even as the market soared. This time he's ready to buy in “when the panic wears off.” Still, he adds: “We can't have this kind of thing happen very often. When the little guy gets frightened, the big guys hurt badly. Merrill Lynch can't survive without the little guy.”

Now along comes Stephen Jay Gould to dash this flattering illusion. His credentials are excellent for the task. Star lecturer at Harvard, author of numerous popular books on science, and scourge of the creationist lobby, Mr. Gould is perhaps the world's most eminent evolutionary theorist. Yet he puts quite a twist on the old story handed down from Darwin. For him, natural history is anything but a gradual, predictable march from primordial slime to human consciousness; it is a careening, chaotic affair in which the emergence of a featherless biped was a one-in-a-million shot.

For instance, Michael dislikes Jackie not because he's a shrewd Jewish businessman, but because he quits his well-paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker. Even more problematic is the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and Mr. Mason's comic persona. The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end (and occasionally in the middle), when Mr. Mason slips into his standup mode and starts meting out that old-fashioned Jewish mischief to other people as well as to himself. But too often, these routines lack spark because this sitcom, like all sitcoms, is timid about confronting Mr. Mason's stock in trade - ethnic differences.

But Japanese investors say that their reluctance to invest stems not only from concerns about Mexico's economic outlook, but also reservations about Mexico's recently revamped investment law. Unable to get a new law through a congress with a strong leftist bloc, Mexico jury-rigged the existing law's regulations. It created special 20-year trusts to allow foreigners 100% ownership in some once-closed industries. It also made artful use of semantics, redefining as non-strategic industries some that had been in the national domain.

They are very considerable: Since 1986, when Spain joined the European Community, its gross domestic product has grown at an annual average of 4.6% - the fastest in the EC.

Mr. Sweig estimated that Merck's profit for the quarter rose by about 22%, propelled by sales of its line-up of fast-growing prescription drugs, including its anti-cholesterol drug, Mevacor; a high blood pressure medicine, Vasotec; Primaxin, an antibiotic, and Pepcid, an anti-ulcer medication. Profit climbed even though Merck's sales were reduced by “one to three percentage points” as a result of the strong dollar, Mr. Sweig said.

The combined value of daily equity trading on the New York Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ over-the-counter market ranges between $7 billion and $10 billion. The $13 billion the Fed injected into the money markets after the 1987 crash is more than enough to buy all the stocks traded on a typical day. More carefully targeted intervention might actually reduce the need for government action. And taking more direct action has the advantage of avoiding sharp increases in the money supply, such as happened in October 1987.

WCRS's restructuring reflects the growing importance of media buying in Europe, where the only way to get a good price on advertising time and space is to buy it in bulk.

It also gives the outspoken Mr. Della Femina - who often generates as much publicity for himself as for his clients - an international platform that he most certainly won't be loath to use.

MITI officials hope to avoid yet-another source of trade friction with the U.S. even though export restraints currently limit Japanese car exports to the U.S.

The greatest contribution Congress could make at this time would be to declare that stabilizing the price level is the primary responsibility of the Federal Reserve System. Legislation to this effect has been introduced in Congress in this session by Rep. Stephen Neal (D., N.C.). It is not the kind of thing that is likely to be enacted, however. Congress would be required to make a hard decision, and Congress would much prefer to leave the hard decision to the Fed and retain its rights of complaint after the fact.

Besides the designer's age, other risk factors for Mr. Cray's new company include the Cray-3's tricky, unproven chip technology. The SEC documents describe those chips, which are made of gallium arsenide, as being so fragile and minute they will require special robotic handling equipment. In addition, the Cray-3 will contain 16 processors - twice as many as the largest current supercomputer.

Sanjay Joshi, European economist at Baring Brothers & Co., said there is no sign that Britain's manufacturing industry is transforming itself to boost exports. At the same time, he remains fairly pessimistic about the outlook for imports, given continued high consumer and capital goods inflows. He reckons the current account deficit will narrow to only # 1.8 billion in September. However, Mr. Dillow said he believes that a reduction in raw material stockbuilding by industry could lead to a sharp drop in imports. Combined with at least some rebound in exports after August's unexpected decline, the deficit could narrow to as little as # 1.3 billion.
