Credit policy should separate these two competing objectives and eliminate aspects that provide the subsidy. For example, student loans currently attempt to subsidize college attendance and mitigate problems created by the fact that students' future earnings are not accepted as collateral. The program provides highly subsidized loans to any student whose family earns less than a particular amount. High default rates, a low interest rate, and government coverage of all interest costs while the student is in school make program costs extremely high. Families that do not need the loan can make money simply by putting the loan in the bank and paying it back when the student graduates.

Wells Rich first popularized the Benson & Hedges brand more than 20 years ago with ads portraying, among other things, an elevator door closing on a passenger's cigarette. The brand early on achieved an upscale appeal - a trait that some analysts believe is partly responsible for its staid performance.

Some of the recent selling could actually be considered a positive sign. Mutual funds, for example, are said to be selling existing municipal bonds to raise cash to buy new issues.

In the early 1980s, I predicted a significant acceleration in productivity growth over the rest of the decade. This forecast was based on the apparent reversal of most of the negative forces - such as demographic changes, the oil shock and accelerating inflation - that had reduced productivity gains in the 1970s. There has indeed been more than a one percentage point improvement in productivity growth since 1981. But I had expected more, which is one reason I began looking at evidence suggesting defects in the official output estimates. The evidence does not clearly support the view that the downward bias in output growth has become greater during the 1948-89 period, but all I am claiming is that the growth trend is understated. (It is, however, possible, that further study will reveal increasing bias.)

Last year, Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice John P. Flaherty called Mr.O'Kicki one of the finest judges “not only in Pennsylvania but in the United States.” Clearly, the judge has had his share of accomplishments. After practicing law locally, he was elected to his first 10-year term as judge in 1971; in 1981, he was effectively re-elected. Six years ago, JudgeO'Kicki was voted president of the Pennsylvania Conference of State Trial Judges by the state's 400 judges. He has been considered several times for appointments to federal district and appellate court vacancies in Pennsylvania. And when he ran unsuccessfully for a state appellate court seat in 1983, the Pennsylvania Bar Association rated him “one of the best available,” after interviewing local lawyers.

“The import pie will shrink,” says John Kamm, first vice president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and a China trade specialist. “On the down side, sales could fall as much as 90% for some companies; on the upper side, sales will be flat.” China's foreign trade has gone in cycles during the past decade. The last time that traders experienced a trough was during 1985-86, when Beijing imposed tough measures to curb imports and conserve foreign exchange. The current trough is expected to be much deeper, because Beijing has cut off domestic funds from factories for the first time to slow inflation. In addition, the suspension of loans and export credits from foreign governments and institutions following the June killings have been a big setback.

Twenty-five years ago the poet Richard Wilbur modernized this 17th-century comedy merely by avoiding “the zounds sort of thing,” as he wrote in his introduction. Otherwise, the scene remained Celimene's house in 1666. Assuming modern audiences readily understand that Moliere's social indictment covers their world as well as 17th-century Paris, Mr. Wilbur concentrated his formidable artistry on rendering the Alexandrine French verse into sprightly and theatrical English iambic pentameter. The Wilbur translation is remarkable - well worth a read and even better seen in the theater if you ever have the opportunity.

To ensure the loyalty of the business sector, Mr. Gorbachev may offer concessions and powers that will allow the business community to preserve its own interests, probably by restricting competition. However, Mr. Gorbachev must ensure that within this “alliance” the business sector remains subordinate to the party. At the same time, he must give it sufficient freedom to provide the economic benefits so desperately needed. It is the promise of economic returns that is supposed to make the corporatist model attractive to both the party and labor.

The sheer number of planners makes the business extremely difficult, if not impossible, to regulate. Even the minority of them who must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission as “investment advisers” - people who are in the business of counseling others on the buying and selling of securities specifically - have been enough to swamp the agency's capacity. The SEC has only about 200 staffers assigned to keep tabs on investment advisers - about the same as in 1980 - even though the number of advisers has tripled to about 15,000 over the past decade. Currently, a registered investment adviser can expect an SEC audit only once every 12 years. A lot of bad things can happen in 12 years. “It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out our problem,” says Kathryn McGrath, director of the SEC's division of investment management.

It is unclear what caused the creditors to do an about-face on exploring alternatives to Eastern's new reorganization plan. However, since Eastern first filed for Chapter 11 protection March 9, it has consistently promised to pay creditors 100 cents on the dollar. Because the carrier is still pledging to do that, some committee members successfully argued that there's little reason yet to explore a different plan, according to one person familiar with the creditors' position. Earlier this month the accounting firm of Ernst & Young and the securities firm of Goldman, Sachs & Co., the experts hired by the creditors, contended that Eastern would have difficulty meeting earnings targets the airline was projecting. Ernst & Young said Eastern's plan would miss projections by $100 million. Goldman said Eastern would miss the same mark by at least $120 million.

When the movie opens the Baker brothers are doing what they've done for 15 years professionally, and twice as long as that for themselves: They're playing proficient piano, face-to-face, on twin pianos. They're small time in the small time-hotels (not the best ones) and restaurants in Seattle. Yet they don't disparage their audiences by disparaging their act. They wear tuxedos most nights, unless circumstances (a regular gig at a “tropical” lounge, for example) require them to wear special costumes, like Hawaiian shirts.

Unlike other writers who either battled the fascists during the Civil War, or left Spain when Franco triumphed, Mr. Cela fought briefly on the general's side, no doubt earning with his war wound some forbearance when he went on to depict a country with a high population of vagabonds, murderers and rural idiots trudging aimlessly through a dried-out land. Still, it was in Argentine editions that his countrymen first read his story of Pascal Duarte, a field worker who stabbed his mother to death and has no regrets as he awaits his end in a prison cell: “Fate directs some men down the flower-bordered path, and others down the road bordered with thistles and prickly pears. The lucky ones gaze out at life with serene eyes and smile with a face of innocence at their perfumed happiness. The others endure the hot sun of the plains and scowl like cornered wild beasts.”

Pre-trial polling helps the consultants develop a profile of the right type of juror. If it is a case in which the client seeks punitive damages, for example, depressed, underemployed people are far more likely to grant them. Someone with a master's degree in classical arts who works in a deli would be ideal, Litigation Sciences advises. So would someone recently divorced or widowed. (Since Litigation Sciences generally represents the defense, its job is usually to help the lawyers identify and remove such people from the jury.)

The bill's managers face criticism, too, for the unusual number of conditions openly imposed on where funds will be spent. Conservatives, embarrassed by Republican influence-peddling scandals at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, have used the issue in an effort to shift blame onto a Democratic-controlled Congress. HUD Secretary Jack Kemp backed an unsuccessful effort to strike such language last week, but received little support from the White House budget office, which wants to protect space-station funding in the bill and has tended to turn its eyes from pork-barrel amendments.

Mr. Krenz, age 52, is known as an old-guard ironfist, one likely to continue the method of running a country that the Berlin Wall made famous. Even if he were to change his stripes and become another Milton Friedman, however, he would still stand a good chance of losing a country.

Even so, traditional American cockiness isn't terribly endangered. Ford officials, for example, crowed about their first-ever Tokyo Grand Prix racing victory.

In many ways, the backdrop to Friday's stock decline is eerily similar to that of October 1987's 508-point crash. Then, as now, the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of taking hold. The Treasury was locked in a battle over international economic policy, although at that time it was with West German officials rather than the Federal Reserve. And concern about official actions aimed at takeovers - then by the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee rather than the Transportation Department - were making markets nervous.

Aichi is a machikin, Mr. Utsunomiya says, and “one of the nasty ones.” In describing that business in general, he says that when the client can't repay the loan, some machikin “clutch on like hyenas” and even take over the client's company. Last month, Mr. Morishita's new gallery, Aska International Ltd., purchased 6.4% of Christies for # 33 million ($53.3 million). Acquired from Carisbrook Holdings U.K. Ltd., a company owned by Australian financier Robert Holmes a Court, the stake was apparently the first of its kind for Aska, an entity separate from Aichi. And the acquisition, which made Aska one of Christies' top five shareholders, left many people wondering who this man was and what his intentions were.

Most political analysts say that if Mr. Gandhi's opposition unites to field single candidates in most precincts, the Congress (I) will lose big.

A spokesman for North Carolina Gov. Martin says Hugo hasn't prompted proposals for state or local increases. California, where earthquake damage may top $5 billion, plans a special legislative session. Property-tax relief is likely.

Needs aren't clear, and the state constitution makes increasing taxes and spending very difficult.

Peter Drake, biotechnology analyst for Vector Securities International, Chicago, thinks market uncertainty may encourage small companies to form more strategic alliances with big corporations. Partly because the 1987 market crash made it harder for them to find financing, many high-technology concerns have made such alliances recently. Some even see a silver lining in the dark clouds. Alan Wells, president of Bollinger, Wells, Lett & Co., a New York merger specialist, thinks panicky investors may lose their enthusiasm for leveraged buy-out and giant takeover deals. Instead, they could turn to investing in smaller deals involving smaller companies, he says.

One of the most prominent features is the requirement that in three years all exchanges have in place a system that records all trades by a source independent of the executing broker. The New York futures exchanges have been working together to develop a trade recording system much like the one called for in the bill. We would be delighted to have such a system in place today. But is it realistic for Congress to mandate by a rigid deadline a system that has not yet been subjected to feasibility studies? What if the system doesn't work?

In one, the lawyer for a 20-year-old resident of Columbia, Mo., who was charged with drunk driving, argued that his client should be treated as a 21-year-old adult because his actual age should be calculated from conception, not from birth.

On U.S.-Philippine relations: “It's such a mixed-up relationship going back into history .... I really do not understand how it is that Filipinos feel so passionately involved in this father figure that they want to dispose of and yet they need. I just don't understand it. My relationships with the British are totally different. They lorded it over me. They did me some good. They did themselves even more good. They let me down when the Japanese came down {during World War II} .... I don't feel down or done in because I show British serials on my television network or read their books. I mean it is a normal adult relationship. “But the Filipinos and the Americans, when I talk to them, there's so much passion about Filipino manhood being diminished as a result of being squatted upon by the Americans and so on. The occasional Englishman tries to put on airs but we let it pass .... It's just comic when they try to pretend they're still the master race.” Mr. Lee added that the Filipinos are “making it very difficult” for the U.S. military presence to last beyond five or 10 years.

An ancient red-figured Greek kylix, or drinking cup, was recovered backstage at Sotheby's this spring and has been returned to the Manhattan couple who lost it in a burglary three years ago. Robert Guy, an associate curator at the Princeton Art Museum, was previewing a June antiquities sale at the auction house when he recognized the kylix, which he, as a specialist in Attic pottery and a careful reader of the Stolen Art Alert in “IFAR Reports,” knew was stolen. The timing of his visit was fortuitous; the man who had brought it in for an estimate had returned to collect it and was waiting in the hall. To confirm Mr. Guy's identification, Sotheby's and IFAR exchanged photos by fax, and the waiting man, apparently innocent of knowledge that the kylix was stolen, agreed to release it. The cup had been insured, and in short order it was given over to a Chubb & Son representative. The original owners happily repaid the claim and took their kylix home.

In contrast to the more artistic nature of traditional cosmetics houses, Unilever and P&G are the habitats of organization men in gray-flannel suits.

However, the short interest figures reported by brokerage and securities clearing firms to the National Association of Securities Dealers include only those trades completed, or settled, by Oct. 13, rather than trades that occurred on that day, according to Gene Finn, chief economist for the NASD.

“I don't trust people who don't eat,” said Ms. Volokh, though she herself stopped eating lunch a few years ago to drop 25 pounds. “Look at Dostoevski and Kafka. No one ever eats in their books and look at them .... Tolstoy's characters eat, Pushkin's, Gogol's.” In her cookbook, which Macmillan is bringing out in soft cover this month (with the blini recipe revised so it works), she introduces each chapter with appropriate quotations from Russian literature: Pushkin on blini, Goncharov on piroghi. In life, she offers practical dieting advice: “Divide your meals into important and unimportant. In a great restaurant, don't deprive yourself. The other meals don't matter.”

The market's pessimism reflects the gloomy outlook in Detroit. As Japanese auto makers gained market share, the Big Three, with GM in the lead, slashed North American production and launched a retail discounting blitz. The price war peaked in the third quarter as Big Three factory discounts climbed to more than $1,000 a vehicle, according to industry officials. GM probably had the “heaviest incentives,” said Robert S. Miller, Chrysler's chief financial officer. “We all did what we had to do to stay within sight of them.”

The point was to answer the question in the conference title, not to try to create news stories for the event itself.

Each scientist independently concluded society and government are underreacting when it comes to substantive policy change. This leads to a very special sense of urgency.

The administration urged the justices to adopt a legal standard suggested by Chief Justice William Rehnquist last July when the high court upheld Missouri's abortion restrictions. Under that standard, which garnered the votes of only three of the nine justices, a state restriction of abortion is constitutional if the state has a “reasonable” justification for adopting it. That is a much easier standard for a state to satisfy than the Supreme Court's test since 1973, which requires a state to have a “compelling” reason for restricting abortion.

Warner also appears to be trying to embarrass Sony by accusing the Japanese company's U.S executives, Messrs. Schulof and Yetnikoff, of dishonorable dealings. In its suit, Warner says that Mr. Ross warned Sony's Mr. Schulof on Sept. 26 at a dinner in Washington, “with Guber Peters in mind” that in the U.S. “it is essential that corporations honor written contracts and do not induce breach of contracts by others.” Sony went ahead the next day anyway and executed its own five-year agreement with the producers and agreed to buy their company, the suit adds. Moreover, the suit adds that Sony initially said it wouldn't buy Guber Peters unless the Warner contract was settled. On Tuesday, although a settlement wasn't reached, Sony publicly announced it would acquire Guber Peters. “Sony has thus knowingly and willfully, and over Warner's protests, induced Guber and Peters to repudiate their contract with Warner,” the suit says.

The upheaval leaves the Thatcher government isolated within the European Community. Six months ago, the British prime minister's two senior cabinet members - Mr. Lawson, chancellor since 1983, and Sir Geoffrey, then the foreign secretary - both supported Britain's early entry into the EMS. With Mr. Lawson out of the cabinet, and Sir Geoffrey in the less-influential job of deputy prime minister, there's little to counter Mrs. Thatcher's innate suspicion of the EC's exchange-rate mechanism. Sir Alan, brought back to Downing Street last spring as her adviser, adamantly opposed it.

Prior to a tender offer by A&P for Waldbaum Inc. in 1986, the founder of the Waldbaum's supermarket chain called an elderly relative to tell her to assemble her stock certificates for delivery. She called her daughter to take her to the bank, who, in turn, persuaded her husband, a Mr. Loeb, to run this errand. Hearing of this information, the husband discussed it with his broker, Mr. Chestman, and Mr. Chestman then bought for his own account and other clients. Basically, Mr. Chestman was a fourth-level tippee. Did Mr. Loeb, his tipper, breach a fiduciary duty (and, if so, to whom)? Did Mr. Loeb seek personal gain (and if so, how)? Or did Mr. Chestman only hear a market rumor (which one may lawfully trade upon)? The line seems awfully thin for criminal-law purposes.

For most of the past 30 years, the marriage was one of convenience. In 1960, for example, when Mr. Noriega was both a cadet at an elite military academy in Peru and a spy-in-training for the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, he was detained by Lima authorities for allegedly raping and savagely beating a prostitute, according to a U.S. Embassy cable from that period. The woman had nearly died. But U.S. intelligence, rather than rein in or cut loose its new spy, merely filed the report away. Mr. Noriega's tips on emerging leftists at his school were deemed more important to U.S. interests. From that point on, the U.S. would make a practice of overlooking the Panamanian's misadventures.

The manufacturers said 14.2% of their spending is designed to improve products or add new ones, 17.5% is to cut costs, 12.5% is for research and development, and the rest is for maintenance and other purposes.

Shearson Lehman Hutton gave small investors some welcome news by announcing that it would no longer handle index-arbitrage-related program trades for its accounts. Shearson, with its in-house order execution system, has handled the bulk of such program trades in the over-the-counter market. The trading has been blamed for much of the market's recent volatility. Jaguar topped the most-active list, as its American depository receipts climbed 1 3\/4 to 13 5\/8 with more than 6.6 million ADRs traded. Britain said it would waive its “golden share” in the luxury auto maker if shareholders vote to allow a suitor to acquire more than 15% of the company. The announcement effectively removes the British government as an impediment to a takeover of the company, which is being stalked by General Motors and Ford.

Conservationists say that drift-net fishing threatens to wipe out much of the world's tuna stocks in a few years. But the Japanese Fisheries Association criticized moves to ban the practice in international waters. “It is really unfortunate for human beings to be swayed by emotional discussions,” the association said. In driftnet, or “wall of death,” fishing, fleets lay nets up to three miles long that trap almost everything in their path. Earlier this year, Japan said it would cut the number of its drift-net vessels in the South Pacific by two-thirds, or down to 20.

A committee of gem dealers investigates the source of some “hot” blue topaz stones recently reported by a Hong Kong jewelry manufacturer. In the U.S., radiation limits are set and monitored by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which licenses reactors that process the topaz. The agency is working on licensing importers but doesn't currently monitor imports. Topaz, a translucent mineral that is often whitish when taken from the ground, can be turned blue by irradiation, which transforms it into a gemstone that looks like an aquamarine.

The work, though, sounds like Muzak for spaceships. Philip Glass is the emperor, and his music the new clothes, of the avant-garde. His success is easy to understand. Softly introducing and explaining his pieces, Mr. Glass looks and sounds more like a shaggy poet describing his work than a classical pianist playing a recital. The piano compositions, which have been labeled variously as minimalist, Oriental, repetitive, cyclical, monophonic and hypnotic, are relentlessly tonal (therefore unthreatening), unvaryingly rhythmic (therefore soporific), and unflaggingly harmonious but unmelodic (therefore both pretty and unconventional). It is music for people who want to hear something different but don't want to work especially hard at the task. It is E-Z listening for the now generation.

Much is being done in Colombia to fight the drug cartel mafia. Luxurious homes and ranches have been raided by the military authorities, and sophisticated and powerful communications equipment have been seized. More than 300 planes and helicopters have been impounded at airports, and a large number of vehicles and launches has been confiscated. The military has also captured enormous arsenals of powerful and sophisticated weapons, explosives and other war-like materiel. Much has been accomplished and public opinion decisively supports the government and the army - but, on the other hand, none of the key drug barons have been captured.

The magazine had its best year yet in 1988, when it celebrated its centennial and racked up a 17% gain in ad pages, to 283. But this year, when the hullabaloo surrounding its centennial died, so too did some advertiser interest. The reason, ad executives say, is that the entire magazine business has been soft - and National Geographic has some quirks that make it especially unattractive during a soft market.

These findings illustrate the vicious cycle that National Institute of Justice Director James K. Stewart calls “crime causing poverty.” Underclass neighborhoods offer relatively few employment opportunities, contributing to the poverty of local residents. Small neighborhood businesses could provide more jobs, if crime were not so harmful to creating and maintaining those businesses. This may help explain why small businesses create 65% of all jobs nationally, but only 22% of jobs in a crime-ridden city like New York.

Ideologues on the other side of the border can also slow the process. Helmut Kohl's governing conservative coalition is proving admirably true to the West German constitution by making more than 500,000 people of German descent automatic citizens this year alone. But within the government and in the think tanks outside it, many West Germans maintain that they don't want immediate reunification. Politically, this currently is wisdom - particularly given a nervous neighboring France. But it would be ironic if Germany's reunification, just like its division, eventually were the result of actions in centers of power other than Bonn and Berlin.

Finding a test case shouldn't be hard, but there is something to be said for picking the best one possible. The White House had the perfect case, but Congress blinked before it could go to court. After the HUD and S&L stories broke, some Congressmen began to worry that their influence peddling at executive-branch and independent agencies might some day get them in trouble. They worried about an Interior Department directive to log all communications with Members or their staffs. Congress inserted the following into the Interior appropriation: “None of the funds available under this title may be used to prepare reports on contacts between employees of the Dept. of the Interior and Members and committees of Congress and their staff.”

That would be a formula for ensuring even more FHA red ink. Experience has shown that the most important element in predicting a housing-loan default is the down payment. Because a purchaser can use an FHA loan to finance all points and closing costs, the FHA can wind up lending more than a house is worth. If housing prices continue to fall, many borrowers would be better off walking away from their homes and leaving taxpayers with the losses. Much the same thing happened with busted S&Ls, a problem Congress just “solved” with a $166 billion bailout.

Let us sum up what we do know about education and about those education reforms that do work and don't work: - “Parental involvement” is a bad idea.

Much of the money goes into subsidies or keeping inefficient state-controlled companies operating. Among the results is a frequent breakdown of public services. It's not uncommon to wait three minutes for a dial tone after picking up the telephone, and then to be interrupted by a busy signal before finishing dialing the number. Officials also say a national electricity shortage might not be far off. Economists, businessmen and some politicians agree that the answer is an orthodox economic austerity program including reduced state spending; focusing spending on vital areas such as education, health and welfare; turning state companies private; reforming the tax system, raising public service rates to match costs; and possibly a temporary wage and price freeze and a devaluation of the cruzado.

Collectors don't say “It's a van Gogh” anymore, laments Harry Brooks, the president of Wildenstein & Co., a New York gallery. “They say, “Johnny Payson got $53 million for his, so certainly $10 million isn't too much for mine.” The great collectors we depended on, such as Paul Mellon or Norton Simon, have stopped buying, and the new buyers are brilliant men who made money in the stock market or in takeovers and rushed into collecting ....” Mr. Payson, an art dealer and collector, sold Vincent van Gogh's “Irises” at a Sotheby's auction in November 1987 to Australian businessman Alan Bond. (Trouble is, Mr. Bond has yet to pay up, and until he does, Sotheby's has the painting under lock and key.)

Czechoslovakia has restricted consumer-goods exports to neighbor countries because of “massive buying out of food” by tourists from Poland, Hungary and the Soviet Union, the Rude Pravo daily said.

You depict the bill as something Democratic leaders “hoodwinked” the administration into endorsing. The opposite is true: It's the product of many meetings with administration officials, Senate staffers, advocates, and business and transportation officials.

GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Prices closed mixed as contracts reacted to largely offsetting bullish and bearish news. On the Chicago Board of Trade, soybeans for November delivery closed at $5.63 a bushel, down half a cent, while the December wheat contract rose three-quarters of a cent to $4.0775 a bushel. Supporting prices was the announcement late Friday of additional grain sales to the Soviet Union. But acting as a drag on prices was the improved harvest weather over the weekend and the prospect for continued fair weather this week over much of the Farm Belt. Strong farmer selling over the weekend also weighed on prices.

But analysts, and indeed, some of the soda companies, have had difficulty predicting consumer reaction to higher prices.

Blaming higher prices in part, Coca-Cola said its third-quarter unit case sales were flat.

Jeff Bridges is the younger brother, Jack, who fancies himself the rebellious artist; he lives in a loft with his sick dog and the occasional visit from the little girl upstairs, who climbs down the fire escape. Yet Jack's the one who can remember every dive they ever played, and when, and he dutifully shows up for work night after night (he consoles himself with booze and by showing up at the last minute). Looking leaner than he has in a while, the younger Mr. Bridges's Jack is sexy and cynical and a far sadder case than Frank, who's managed to chisel his dreams to fit reality without feeling too cheated.

Junk bonds, which mushroomed from less than $2 billion at the start of this decade, have been declining for months as issuer after issuer sank beneath the weight of hefty interest payments. The shaky market received its biggest jolt last month from Campeau Corp., which created its U.S. retailing empire with junk financing.

The peninsula comes off the vast southeastern alluvial plain with fields of rice and cotton and sorghum as far as the eye can see. Near the coast there are dense coverts of live oak interspersed with marshes and prairies.

Above the blossoms of lantana and scarlet pea the inky-brown and golden palamedes butterfly floats on its lazy wingbeat.

For smaller newspapers, syndicated features can be crucial. Industry executives say the columns and cartoons give newspapers consistency and build fierce reader loyalty. “I have people tell me that Garfield is the only reason they read the {Arkansas} Gazette,” says Walter E. Hussman, the publisher of the competing Arkansas Democrat. Syndicates have traditionally turned down fatter fees from competitors, switching only when a newspaper dropped a feature or some unusual ownership change occurred. In 1984, the Boston Herald stole about 10 features from the bigger Boston Globe, but only after the Herald's owner, Rupert Murdoch, bought the features' syndicator. In 1977, Universal pulled its features from the now-defunct Philadelphia Bulletin because of a contract dispute and because “there was no growth {there} for Universal,” says John McMeel, president and co-owner of Universal.

Mr. Bates usually handles day-to-day UAL trading on his own. But yesterday, the heavy trading action eventually consumed not only Messrs.

The environment can no longer be a normal issue, to be dealt with on a business-as-usual basis with comfortable increments of change. We have literally altered the chemistry and physics of our planet's atmosphere. This portends consequences from what we have already done that will be very destabilizing to social and economic systems. The problems of the environment are so interrelated, so inextricably entwined with our current way of life and so large that it is unlikely we will be able to address them effectively unless major changes are made in less than 10 years. The consensus from the scientific community is that there is sufficient evidence to advise major policy changes. No, we are not overreacting.

Several analysts said they expected Warner-Lambert's profit also to increase by more than 20% from $87.7 million, or $1.25 a share, it reported in the like period last year. The company is praised by analysts for sharply lowering its costs in recent years and shedding numerous companies with low profit margins. The company's lean operation, analysts said, allowed sharp-rising sales from its cholesterol drug, Lopid, to power earnings growth. Lopid sales are expected to be about $300 million this year, up from $190 million in 1988. In Morris Plains, N.J., a spokesman for the company said the analysts' projections are “in the ballpark.”

The harvest arrives in plenty after last year's drought-ravaged effort: The government estimates corn output at 7.45 billion bushels, up 51% from last fall. Soybean production swells 24%. As a result, prices paid to farmers for the commodities, which are used in products as diverse as bubble gum and chicken feed, plummet 20% to 33%. But don't expect too much in the way of price breaks soon at the supermarket. Economists expect consumer food prices to jump 5.5% this year to the highest level since 1980 and up from last year's 4.1% rise. Next year may see a drop of one percentage point.

Betty Raptopoulos, senior metals analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities in New York, agreed that most of the selling was of a technical nature. She said the market hit the $1.18 level at around 10 a.m. EDT where it encountered a large number of stop-loss orders. More stop-loss orders were touched off all the way down to below $1.14, where modest buying was attracted. Ms. Raptopoulos said the settling of strikes in Canada and Mexico will have little effect on supplies of copper until early next year. She thinks the next area of support for copper is in the $1.09 to $1.10 range. “I believe that as soon as the selling abates somewhat we could see a rally back to the $1.20 region,” she added.

Where they lag behind the Japanese is in turning the scientific inventiveness into improved production. By contrast, the Japanese have proved adept at making use of Soviet inventions. Kobe Steel Ltd. adopted Soviet casting technology in 1966 and used it for 14 years until it developed its own system. Kawasaki Steel Corp. bought a Soviet steel-casting patent two years ago and has jointly developed the system with the Soviets. In 1991, the Soviets will take a Japanese journalist into space, the first Japanese to go into orbit.

Under these deals, the RTC sells just the deposits and the healthy assets. These “clean-bank” transactions leave the bulk of bad assets, mostly real estate, with the government, to be sold later. In these four, for instance, the RTC is stuck with $4.51 billion in bad assets. Acquirers paid premiums ranging from 1.5% to 3.7% for the deposits and branch systems, roughly in line with what analysts were expecting.

Japanese money will help turn Southeast Asia into a more cohesive economic region. But, analysts say, Asian cooperation isn't likely to parallel the European Common Market approach. Rather, Japanese investment will spur integration of certain sectors, says Kent Calder, a specialist in East Asian economies at the Woodrow Wilson School for Public and Internatonal Affairs at Princeton University. In electronics, for example, a Japanese company might make television picture tubes in Japan, assemble the sets in Malaysia and export them to Indonesia.

A successful low-crime mall in a high-crime area violates the more typical inner-city pattern, in which commercial areas are taken over by unruly youth, gangs, and the criminal element, with an erosion of the customer base, development capital, and insurability. Major regional and national chain stores are replaced by mom-and-pop operations offering poorer-quality merchandise at higher prices. Along with the exodus of shopping opportunities is an exodus of the jobs that the major chains used to provide to community residents.

For some at the SEC, an agency that covets its independence, Mr. Breeden may be too much of a Washington insider.

With due respect to “highly classified correspondence” and other buzzwords, the leakers are performing a public service.

Back in the 1920s, the play and movie versions of “Abie's Irish Rose” made the theme of courtship between the assimilated offspring of Jewish and Irish immigrants so popular that its author, Anne Nichols, lost a plagiarism suit on the grounds that the plot has entered the public domain.

That is because Sidhpur has a near-monopoly on the world's supply of flea seed, also known as flea wort or, in Western parlance, psyllium: a tiny, tasteless, obscure seed that, according to early research, may reduce cholesterol levels in the blood. Ever since the link to cholesterol was disclosed, Americans have begun scarfing up psyllium in their breakfast cereals. If further research proves the seed's benefits, this dusty farm district could become the epicenter of a health-food fad to rival all fads since cod-liver oil.

But when the high court ruled in the Webster case in July, the president began to lower the volume. When the ruling was handed down, the vacationing president dispatched Chief of Staff John Sununu to issue a statement and refused to answer questions himself. He did later threaten vetoes over legislation restoring the District of Columbia's right to use its own tax money to fund abortions for poor women and over restoring funding to the United Nations Population Fund. But in the months since then, while trying to drum up support for other issues - such as an anti-flag-burning constitutional amendment - he has shied away from talking about abortion. What few comments he has initiated have been oblique, such as urging “greater efforts toward the protection of human life” at a meeting of Catholic lawyers in Boston last month.

COPPER: Futures prices eased on indications of improvement in the industry's labor situation. The December contract declined 1.85 cents a pound to $1.2645. According to one analyst, workers at the Cananea copper mine in Mexico, which hasn't been operating since it was declared bankrupt by the Mexican government in late August, are set to return to work. The analyst said it will take about two to three months before the mine begins to produce copper in significant quantities. He added that, while there hasn't been any official announcement as yet, the Highland Valley mine strike in British Columbia, which has lasted more than three months, is regarded as settled. Another analyst said the Cananea return to operation may not be as near as some expect. “There are still negotiations taking place on whether there will be a loss of jobs, which has been a critical issue all along,” he said. Nevertheless, the increasing likelihood that these two major supply disruptions will be resolved weighed on the market, the analysts agreed. Both of these mines are normally major suppliers of copper to Japan, which has been buying copper on the world market. The first analyst said that the Japanese, as well as the Chinese, bought copper earlier in the week in London, but that this purchasing has since slackened as the supply situation, at least over the long term, appears to have improved. “The focus for some time has been on the copper supply, and good demand has been taken for granted,” he said. “Now that the supply situation seems to be improving, it would be best for traders to switch their concentration to the demand side.” He noted the Commerce Department report yesterday that housing starts in September dropped 5.2% from August to 1.26 million units on an annualized basis, the lowest level in seven years. “Along with these factors, other economic reports suggest a slowing of the economy, which could mean reduced copper usage,” he said.

Reports of Dr. Toseland's findings in the British press have triggered widespread concern among diabetics there. Both the British Diabetic Association and the Committee on Safety in Medicines - Britain's equivalent of the U.S. FDA - recently issued statements noting the lack of hard scientific evidence to support Dr. Toseland's findings. On Friday, the American Diabetes Association issued a similar statement urging the six million U.S. diabetics not to overreact to the British report.

Mr. Bush is plainly uncomfortable with the entire abortion question. For most of the past nine years, he has striven to convince anti-abortion activists of his stalwart support for their position.

Mr. Dinkins lost twice by wide margins before finally getting elected borough president in 1985. But by most accounts, he made little of the post and was best known among city politicians for his problems making up his mind on matters before the city's Board of Estimate, the body that votes on crucial budget and land-use matters. Colleagues today recall with some humor how meetings would crawl into the early morning hours as Mr. Dinkins would march his staff out of board meetings and into his private office to discuss, en masse, certain controversial proposals. “He taught me how to drink herbal tea instead of coffee at 3 a.m., I'll give him that,” says Deputy Mayor Robert Esnard.

The concept begot a slew of copycats, but the banks stopped promoting the packages. One big reason: thin margins. Many banks, particularly smaller ones, were slow to computerize and couldn't target market niches that would have made the programs more profitable.

The first thing anybody will tell you about ballooning is that it requires zip in the way of athletic prowess, or even a measure of derring-do. (So long as you don't look down.) They will also tell you that even if you hate heights, you can still balloon. (I still say don't look down. At least not when you are ascending.) What they won't tell you is not to go aloft in anything you don't want to get wet. I'm not referring to the traditional champagne drenching during the back-on-terra-firma toast. I'm talking about landing in a canal. In a porous wicker basket. With a pilot who speaks no English.

In point of fact, volatility as measured by the annualized standard deviation of daily stock price movements has frequently been much higher than it is today. Periods before the advent of futures or program trading were often more volatile, usually when fundamental market conditions were undergoing change (1973-75, 1937-40, and 1928-33 for example). It is interesting to see the fundamental stock pickers scream “foul” on program trading when the markets decline, while hailing the great values still abounding as the markets rise. Could rising volatility possibly be related to uncertainty about the economics of stocks, instead of the evil deeds of program-trading goblins?

An admittedly limited survey by NASAA, whose members are state securities-law regulators, found that between 1986 and 1988 “fraud and abuse” by financial planners cost 22,000 investors $400 million. The rogues' gallery of planners involved includes some convicted felons, a compulsive gambler or two, various businessmen who had planned their own previous ventures right into bankruptcy, and one man who scammed his wife's grandmother.

All the while, Ms. Bartlett had been busy at her assignment, serene in her sense of self-tilth. As she put it in a 1987 lecture at the Harvard Graduate School of Design: “I have designed a garden, not knowing the difference between a rhododendron and a tulip.” Moreover, she proclaimed that “landscape architects have been going wrong for the last 20 years” in the design of open space. And she further stunned her listeners by revealing her secret garden design method: Commissioning a friend to spend “five or six thousand dollars ... on books that I ultimately cut up.” After that, the layout had been easy. “I've always relied heavily on the grid and found it never to fail.” Ms. Bartlett told her audience that she absolutely did not believe in compromise or in giving in to the client “because I don't think you can do watered-down versions of things.” (This was never a problem with South Gardens, because the client had long since given in to Ms. Bartlett's every whim.)

Some of the would-be reformers, however, want to restore an arrangement we once had - or, at least, part of it. In the beginning, the treasury secretary and the comptroller of the currency were both ex officio members of the Federal Reserve Board. But in 1935, when Congress was trying to find someone or something to blame for the Great Depression, it decided to drop both the secretary and the comptroller from the board.

Citicorp and Chase told the buy-out group they were “highly confident” they could raise the remaining $4.2 billion needed to finance the deal.

Citibank's confidence was bolstered as recently as 10 days ago when representatives of 120 banks that had expressed interest in the UAL transaction attended a meeting with Citibank representatives. “Ninety percent of the questions asked were friendly,” said a person who attended. “There were a lot of indications both before and after that this was a deal people thought well of.”

Last year, the top 12 players on each NFL team took home an average $536,000, a figure comparable to baseball and higher than in basketball. First-round draft picks have done even better: Average salaries and bonuses for them rose to $685,000 this year, up 44% from 1987. “It's a vicious circle,” says Art Modell, owner of the Cleveland Browns. “One team pays so much and the other pays more.

Pemex, which produces 40% of government revenue, desperately needs new investment.

A bloated payroll and pervasive graft caused Pemex's operating costs to balloon to 95 cents of each $1 in sales, far above the industry norm.

Details of credit enhancements vary widely from issue to issue. Still, they play a crucial role in winning top ratings for most asset-backed issues - which in turn is why the yield above Treasurys is so slim. But skeptics ask why you should bother buying this stuff when you can get only slightly lower yields on government-guaranteed paper. When you buy an asset-backed issue, you take the risk that a bank or an insurer could run into unexpected difficulties. If a bank's credit rating was lowered because of, say, its loans to Third World nations, that could also affect the ratings, liquidity and prices of the asset-backed issues that the bank supports.

Wells Fargo has sold all of its non-trade loans made to less-developed countries, and managed to partly reverse the sharp rise in domestic non-accrual loans, which fell 8% from the previous quarter to $806.8 million from $880.9 million. But the amount was still 39% higher than the year-ago level, and 25% higher as a percentage of total loans. That trend, and Wells Fargo's heavy exposure to leveraged buy-outs, are about the only worries analysts have about Wells Fargo's financial picture. Wells Fargo is rebuilding its loan-loss reserve, which increased to $711 million at Sept. 30 from $664 million the previous quarter but was down from $852 million a year ago, when the bank still had some shaky foreign loans.

John Lehman's editorial-page article on the Pentagon as a haunted house omits the real roots of its ghost population (“In the Pentagon, the Undead Walk,” Oct. 18). The media's treatment of the Defense Department during the Vietnam War, the Carter administration's denigration of the military, and the public scapegoating of Lt. Col. Oliver North have all served to emasculate the poor souls who live there. The resulting haunted house tends to reward followership, not leadership, it creates guilt about wearing the uniform, and raises doubt about having the will to fulfill the ghosts' role, i.e., to be able to win if called on.

A handful of hot retail locations, such as the 57th Street and Madison and Fifth Avenue areas, have been able to sustain what many see as astronomical rents. And, in some neighborhoods, rents have merely hit a plateau. But on average, Manhattan retail rents have dropped 10% to 15% in the past six months alone, experts say. That follows a more subtle decline in the prior six months, after Manhattan rents had run up rapidly since 1986.

For an American reader, part of the charm of this engaging novel should come in recognizing that Japan isn't the buttoned-down society of contemporary American lore. It's also refreshing to read a Japanese author who clearly doesn't belong to the self-aggrandizing “we-Japanese” school of writers who perpetuate the notion of the unique Japanese, unfathomable by outsiders. If “A Wild Sheep Chase” carries an implicit message for international relations, it's that the Japanese are more like us than most of us think.

Mr. Ross and his team at Warner appear to view the move by the two producers to Sony as a personal betrayal after years of support and friendship. “Warner has been nurturing its relationship with Guber and Peters since 1972, long before their recent success,” the Warner suit says.

In August 1983, Mr. Noriega took over as General and de-facto dictator of Panama, having maneuvered his way to the top only two years after the mysterious death in a plane crash of his old boss Omar Torrijos. Soon, the military became a veritable mafia controlling legal and illegal businesses. The Reagan administration also put Mr. Noriega's G-2 back on the U.S. payroll. Payments averaged nearly $200,000 a year from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency and the CIA.

The deregulation of railroads and trucking companies that began in 1980 enabled shippers to bargain for transportation. Carriers could use their equipment more efficiently, leading to overcapacity they were eager to fill. Shippers cut about $35 billion from their annual, inter-city truck and rail costs, to about $150 billion, or about 6.4% of gross national product, down from 8% of GNP in 1981. But with much of the inefficiency squeezed out of the freight-transport system, rising costs are likely to be reflected directly in higher freight rates.

Advertisers are resisting higher prices, which would help close the gap. CBS signed General Motors and Toyota to be the only auto-maker sponsors in baseball for four years. Price: $265 million. But ad executives who negotiated the deal say that works out to only $275,000 for a 30-second ad in the World Series through 1993 - 17% less than what ABC is charging for the Series this month. Moreover, “there's no question ad rates will come down considerably” from the GM-Toyota price, says Arnold Chase of Bozell Inc. Other admen, however, say rates could rise later if ad spending surges.

Some companies are cutting costs and hoping for the best. Telos Corp., a Santa Monica, Calif., provider of software-development and hardware-maintenance services to the military, enjoyed steady growth until this year. Following a tripling of earnings, to $3.9 million, on a doubling of revenue, to $116 million, over four years, earnings in the company's fiscal first quarter, which ended June 30, plunged 90% to $45,000. A one-time write-off for booking nonexistent revenue was partly to blame, but so were lower profits from a stingier contract with the Army and delays in getting paid.

The Senate voted to authorize $4.5 billion for SDI spending in the current fiscal year, but the House, reflecting a dramatic erosion of support for the program, earmarked only $3.1 billion.

But if the A's hadn't won in four, they would have prevailed in five, or six, or seven. The best team won this Series, which is more unusual than it may sound.

And as the graying men returned to their homes, the ANC, outlawed in South Africa since 1960 and still considered to be the chief public enemy by the white government, defiantly returned to the streets of the country's black townships. A huge ANC flag, with black, green and gold stripes, was hoisted over the rickety gate at Mr. Sisulu's modest house, while on the street out front, boys displayed the ANC colors on their shirts, caps and scarves. At the small four-room home of Elias Motsoaledi, a leading ANC unionist and a former commander in the group's armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, well-wishers stuck little ANC flags in their hair and a man tooted on an antelope horn wrapped in ANC ribbons.

Denver is another metropolitan area where the commercial real-estate market has overreacted to the region's economic trends, although Denver has not experienced as severe an economic downturn as Houston.

Employment is now 4% higher than in 1983. Buying income in real dollars actually increased 15% between 1983 and 1987 (the most recent year available).

Two ironies intrude. This has been widely dubbed the BART Series, after the local subway line, and the Bay Bridge Series. Flags fly at half-staff for the death of Bart Giamatti, the late baseball commissioner, and now the Bay Bridge lies in ruins. A Series that was shaping up as the dullest since the one-sided Detroit-over-San Diego go of 1984 has become memorable in the least fortunate way. Still, its edge is lost. It now will be played mostly for the record, and should be wrapped up as quickly as possible, without “off” days.

Of course I'd rather have a computer software firm in my backyard than a hazardous waste incinerator. But I'd also rather live next door to an incinerator than to some of the hog farms I've seen (and smelt) in these parts. An incinerator is also probably better than having nobody next door - on our farm there are four unoccupied houses. On my four-mile drive to farm headquarters each morning, I drive by another four empty houses. A community of abandoned farmsteads, failing businesses, and crumbling roads and bridges is hardly a desirable one .... The loss of 40 jobs by a depressed county in rural Missouri is hardly of national importance except for this: If the most environmentally safe way of dealing with a national problem can not be built in Atchinson County, what hope have we for dealing with the wastes our economy produces? After all, farmers here work with “hazardous” chemicals every day, many of them the same chemicals that would have been destroyed in the incinerator. We know they are dangerous, but if handled with care, their benefits far outweigh any risk to the environment.

Brooks Brothers hopes that shaking its time-honored traditions will attract more young men and more women and change consumer perceptions about its range of merchandise. “We have men who only buy their shirts and underwear here or younger customers who only buy their {job} interview suit here,” says William Roberti, chairman and chief executive officer of Brooks Brothers. “We want them to buy more of their wardrobe here.” Industry watchers agree that Brooks Brothers is long overdue in updating its buttoned-down image, which has stunted its growth. When acquired in May 1988 by British retailer Marks & Spencer PLC, Brooks Brothers' annual operating profit was about $41.8 million on sales of $290.1 million. Mr. Roberti concedes that since the $750 million takeover, “sales growth hasn't been dramatic.” For the 11 months ended March 31, operating profit at the 52-store chain totaled $40.5 million on sales of $286.8 million.

Investigating Jupiter in detail may provide clues to what astronomer Tobias Owen calls the “cosmic paradox” of life: Jupiter and other bodies in the outer solar system are rich in elements such as hydrogen that are essential for life on Earth, but these planets are lifeless; Earth, on the other hand, has a diminished store of such material but is rich in life. Some scientists have suggested that comets and asteroids may have brought enough of this kind of material from the outer solar system to Earth to spawn life.

Magnetic brain tweaking started in the early 1900s, when researchers produced flashes of light in the visual field with magnets. In the 1960s, Mayo Clinic researchers developed magnetic devices to stimulate motor nerves in the hand and other limbs.

The operative definition of newsworthiness will favor virtually unrestrained use of personal, sensitive and intimate facts. Traditional standards of relevancy and importance (“is this something the public ought to know”) will be replaced by a much broader test (“is this something the public is interested in knowing”). And, since the public has always been fascinated by gossip and voyeurism, reporters and editors will strain for creative angles to justify the inclusion of collateral facts about private lives including sexual activities and domestic relationships, activities of family members, and all matters about mental and physical health. Similarly, visual images will be more vivid, sensational and, sometimes, gruesome. One consequence of the trend toward tabloid standards of taste will be fierce attacks from politicians who will find sufficient evidence of abuse to arouse an already cynical public to control the press.

Most of the two dozen scientists taking the podium reported results with new, more sophisticated variations of the seemingly simple electrolysis-of-water experiments described last March by Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons. The experiments involve encircling a thin rod of palladium metal with a wire of platinum and plunging the two electrodes into “heavy” water in which the hydrogen atoms are a doubly heavy form known as deuterium. When an electric current is applied to the palladium and platinum electrodes, the heavy water did begin to break up, or dissociate. Ordinarily the electrolysis, or breakup, of the water would consume almost all of the electrical energy. But Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons said their experiments also produced large amounts of heat. The heat energy plus the energy consumed by the breakup of the water molecules added to far more energy coming out of the apparatus than electrical energy going in, they reported. Because they also detected tritium and indications of nuclear radiation, they asserted that the “excess” heat energy must be coming from energy released by the nuclear fusion of deuterium atoms inside the palladium rod.

Those events continue to move at a rate, and in a direction, which leave informed commentary - let alone policy - far in their wake. Earlier this week, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze confessed that the U.S.S.R. ignored universal human values by invading Afghanistan and, to put it bluntly, “engaged in a violation of the ABM Treaty” by building its radar station at Krasnoyarsk. Hungary is no longer a “Socialist Peoples” republic, the Communist Party no longer has automatic delegates in the U.S.S.R.'s Congress of Peoples Deputies and Egon Krenz was not backed unanimously by his fellow party functionaries when he took over as East Germany's new maximum leader. All of that is just for starters, or so the hundreds of thousands of Eastern Europeans in the streets seem to hope and are certainly demanding.

Executives say Mr. Gorbachev's moves to break up the government's foreign trade monopoly have created uncertainties as well as opportunities. Changing legislation has opened the field to thousands of inexperienced Soviet players, many who promise more than they can deliver. And some foreign firms are finding that even when they manage to overcome such hurdles, their ventures now have to be endorsed by such unpredictable bodies as the Soviet parliament and the governments of the nation's republics.

The Soviet entrenchment in Nicaragua is alarming for Costa Rica, a peaceful democracy without an army. Questioned in Washington about what would happen if his much-heralded peace plan would fail, President Arias voiced expectations of direct U.S. action. A poll conducted in July by a Gallup affiliate showed that 64% of Costa Ricans believe that if their country is militarily attacked by either Nicaragua or Panama, the U.S. will come to its defense. But in the light of events in Panama, where the U.S. has such clear strategic interests, waiting for the Delta Force may prove to be a dangerous gambit.

Third-quarter sales of U.S. credit services were “disappointingly below sales” of a year earlier, Dun & Bradstreet said. As previously reported, those sales have been declining this year in the wake of allegations that the company engaged in unfair sales practices that encouraged customers to overpurchase services. The company has denied the allegations but has negotiated a proposed $18 million settlement of related lawsuits. Analysts predict the sales impact will linger. “There isn't much question there will continue to be a ripple effect,” said John Reidy, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.

Exclusive of the gain, operating profit declined 35% to $16.4 million, or 21 cents a share, from $25.2 million, or 31 cents a share. The decline primarily reflected the dilution from acquiring McCall's, Golf World (U.S.) and Sailing World magazines; lower equity earnings from the forest-products group because of price discounting and an unfavorable exchange rate, and an 8.7% decline in advertising linage at the New York Times, the company's flagship newspaper. Advertising volume at the company's 35 regional newspapers decreased 1.1%. The company said the negative factors are expected to continue into next year.

For the nine months ended June 30, CenTrust had a net loss of $21.3 million, compared with year-earlier net income of $52.8 million. CenTrust, which is Florida's largest thrift, holds one of the largest junk-bond portfolios of any thrift in the nation. Since April, it has pared its high-yield bond holdings to about $890 million from $1.35 billion. Mr. Paul said only about $150 million of the current holdings are tradeable securities registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The remainder, he said, are commercial loan participations, or private placements, that aren't filed with the SEC and don't have a ready market.

The DLC plan envisaged “volunteers” planting trees, emptying bedpans, tutoring children, and assisting librarians for $100 a week, tax free, plus medical care. With a tax-free $10,000 voucher payment at the end of each year, the volunteers would be making a wage comparable to $17,500 a year.

Within the appropriations conference yesterday, the $67 billion measure is the second largest of the annual domestic spending bills and covers a disparate collection of accounts for science, housing, veterans and the environment.

Nevertheless, the Bush administration agreed to the dubious arrangement in July, a few weeks before the Central American presidents met in Tela, Honduras, to discuss a timetable for disbanding the anti-Sandinista rebels. According to officials in Washington, the State Department hoped that by pleasing President Arias, it would gain his support to postpone any decision on the Contras until after Mr. Ortega's promises of democratic elections were tested next February. However, relying on an ardent critic of the Reagan administration and the Contra movement for help in delaying the disarming of the Contras was risky business. And even some last-minute phone calls that Mr. Bush made (at the behest of some conservative U.S. senators) to enlist backing for the U.S. position failed to stop the march of Mr. Arias's agenda.

Last year, the U.S. brokered a peace settlement to remove Cuba's “Afrika Korps” from Angola and hold “free and fair” elections that would end South Africa's control of Namibia. The elections are set for Nov. 7. In July, Mr. Stanley, editor of American Press International, a Washington D.C.-based conservative wire service, visited Namibia to report on the U.N.-monitored election campaign. He interviewed Mr.O'Linn, head of a commission charged with investigating electoral intimidation, and reported that Mr.O'Linn was openly sympathetic to SWAPO and indeed had defended its leaders in court. After Mr. Stanley's article was published in two Namibian newspapers, Mr.O'Linn had criminal charges brought against their editors, publisher and lawyer. Mr. Stanley was arrested and charged along with the others when he returned to Namibia this month.

The market planning and sales promotion office of Nomura Securities Co., for example, has more than 30 computers for its 60 workers, a respectable ratio. But the machines aren't on employees' desks; they ring the perimeter of the large office. Some machines make charts for presentations. Others analyze the data. To transfer information from one to the other, employees make printouts and enter the data manually. To transmit charts to branch offices, they use a fax machine. Meanwhile, a woman sitting next to a new Fujitsu terminal writes stock-market information on a chart with a pencil and adds it up with a hand calculator. In an efficient setup, the same PC could perform all those tasks.

In 1983, Mr. Hastings was found not guilty of accepting a $150,000 bribe in a case before him, the central charge on which the Senate convicted him. He was only the sixth federal judge ever ousted from office after an impeachment trial.

Between 1978 and 1987, for instance, SH Oil in Winter Haven, Fla., sold interests in oil wells to a very select group of local residents, while turning away numerous other eager investors.

It was not until the early 1970s that Cambridge Prof. Harry Whittington and two sharp graduate students began to publish a reinterpretation of the Burgess Shale. By making clever inferences about how the squashed and distorted fossil remains corresponded to three-dimensional structures, this trio was able to piece together a series of wondrous beasties quite unlike anything currently on the planet. One was so fantastic in appearance, it was dubbed Hallucigenia.

Of course, established corporate managements often tend to applaud the setbacks of stock speculators and takeover artists.

Asked whether Friday's action could help him avoid being Trumped by the New York real estate magnate, Mr. Crandall smiled broadly and said: “No comment.”

For many, it began to look like a replay of Oct. 13. As stocks and stock-index futures fell, a trading limit was hit in the S&P 500 stock futures pit. Under a post-1987 crash reform, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange wouldn't permit the December S&P futures to fall further than 12 points for a half hour. That caused a brief period of panic selling of stocks on the Big Board. But at a critical moment, stock-index arbitrage traders showed their power and control. They scooped up hundreds of S&P futures when the market needed it most.

Where had all the money come from? The young John Gutfreund had been discovered by Billy Salomon of Salomon Bros. when he was still a bearded liberal, and put to work as a trader, and then as a rough-and-tumble syndicator. ““Get off your ...,” he would bellow,” say the authors. Rising in the firm, he became powerful and bland, though his new wife, Susan, made him shine in the gossip columns with her profligate spending habits and flamboyant frocks. After he had been head of the company for 3 1\/2 years, he and his partners sold it to Phibro, a powerful commodity trading outfit, for $550 million in Phibro stock. Limited partner Billy Salomon, whose family name had been on the firm's door for 70 years and who had hoped it would be there forever, was not consulted. Mr. Gutfreund collected $32 million, while Billy Salomon got $10 million, much less than if he had conducted the sale. “I felt betrayed,” he later said. Worse, Salomon's timing had been off. Its profits, unlike Phibro's, soared over the next two years, and had it held out, Salomon could have gotten an even bigger bundle.

The great Growth Bull Market began in June 1978 just when the late Rep. William Steiger's proposal to cut the capital-gains tax to 25% from almost 50% began to gather majority support in Congress. The bull market in growth stocks halted when the rate was hiked to 28% from 20% effective January 1987. The Dow and other averages continued to advance, but growth-stock multiples suffered sclerosis from that point until this summer, when the market began to realize the rate might indeed be lowered. All the indexes surged when a lower rate passed the House. The UAL financing reverse shocked the market, but the prospect of capital gains not fulfilling the market's hopes was also an important factor.

As a fan of older movies from the 1920s on, I do not find modern comedies contain violence, sex and foul language to any greater degree than other recent movies. Older movies have plenty of violence, though it is portrayed in keeping with the more restrictive social conventions of the time. For example, one of my favorite movies is the 1949 British comedy “Kind Hearts and Coronets,” in which the entire comedy is based on actor Dennis Price's murdering eight titled relatives (all played by Alec Guinness) because they snubbed his mother and stand in the way of his acquiring the family title. Similarly, one of the most popular comedy genres of the 1930s and '40s was the “murder mystery\/comedy.” The “Thin Man” series of movies, as well as many others, based their entire comedic appeal on the star detectives' witty quips and puns as other characters in the movies were murdered.

Though Boeing's stock price was battered along with the rest of the market Friday, it actually has risen over the last two weeks on the strength of new orders. “The market has taken two views: that the labor situation will get settled in the short term and that things look very rosy for Boeing in the long term,” said Howard Rubel, an analyst at Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc. Boeing's shares fell $4 Friday to close at $57.375 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

But success for Unilever and P&G is far from guaranteed, as shown by the many consumer-product companies that have tried and failed to master the quirky beauty business. In the 1970s, several pharmaceutical and packaged-goods companies, including Colgate-Palmolive Co., Eli Lilly & Co., Pfizer Inc. and Schering-Plough acquired cosmetics companies. Industry consultants say only Schering-Plough, which makes the mass-market Maybelline, has maintained a meaningful business. Colgate, which acquired Helena Rubenstein in 1973, sold the brand seven years later after the brand languished.

ENERGY: The attitude was “wait-and-see” in crude oil futures yesterday in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices for the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude remained locked in a fairly narrow range before ending the session four cents lower at $19.72 a barrel for December delivery. Several analysts and brokers said the petroleum market was ready to rally after two days of price declines from profit-taking. But an early 80-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average stopped the crude rally cold. The industrial average recovered to close only 3.69 points lower, but petroleum futures never shook off the chill. Most market participants said they were looking to this week's inventory statistics from the American Petroleum Institute to give the market some direction. The report isn't generally available until late on Tuesdays.

This raises the key issue: What to do about people who suffer serious injuries from beneficial drugs? We now know that holding drug makers liable where there's no evidence that they or anyone else knew of any risks only means the drugs won't be available to anyone. As liability expert Peter Huber tells us, after the Hymowitz case, if any drug maker introduces an anti-miscarriage drug “it's time to sell that company's stock short.” We also know that the tort system is a lousy way to compensate victims anyway; some win the legal lottery, others get much less and contingency-fee lawyers take a big cut either way.

Like Brecht, and indeed Ezra Pound, Ms. Bogart has said that her intent in such manipulative staging of the classics is simply an attempt to “make it new.” Indeed, during a recent post-production audience discussion, the director explained that her fondest artistic wish was to find a way to play “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” so that the song's “original beauty comes through,” surmounting the cliche. The danger that Ms. Bogart seems to be courting here is one of obfuscation rather than rejuvenation, a vision so at odds with the playwright's that the two points of view nullify, rather than illuminate, each other.

Now many Republicans are listening. They're frightened by what they see in New Jersey, and especially Virginia, where pro-life GOP candidates for governor are being pummeled on abortion. Eddie Mahe, a Republican consultant, says the two GOP candidates could have avoided trouble if they had framed the issue first. (In Virginia, Marshall Coleman and his running mate, Eddy Dalton, are both on the defensive for opposing abortions even in cases of rape or incest.) But Mr. Mahe adds, “The net loser in the next few years is the right-to-life side.”

Topping the cheese stunt, on another typical evening of fun on “Wetten Dass,” a contestant won a bet with the show's host, Thomas Gottschalk, that he could identify 300 German dialects over the telephone.

Mr. Burt nonetheless paid the penalty as if he had lost, agreeing to spend a day with West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher frying and selling their combined weight in potato pancakes.

The FBI is very supportive of and an active participant in Mr. Bennett's initiative. It was agreed at the outset of the Washington Drug Initiative that the FBI's role would be to continue targeting the major drug traffickers through our National Drug Strategy. Through these investigations we do not focus on the street drug user, but rather we target and attack major drug-trafficking organizations that control a large segment of the drug market. The trial of Raful Edmond III in Washington serves to highlight our efforts in this area and the results achieved through our excellent working relationship with the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD).
