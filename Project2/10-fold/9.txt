First, its position in the government is anomalous. It has an unusual kind of independence from elected officials and still has authority over one of the most powerful of government's instruments - the control of the money supply. Thus we have a condition that is easily described as undemocratic. Second, the responsibilities of the Federal Reserve as guardian of the currency, which means as guardian of the stability of the price level, sometimes lead it to take measures that are unpopular. As former Fed Chairman William McChesney Martin used to say, they would have to take the punch bowl away just as the party is getting interesting.

SUGAR: Futures prices extended Tuesday's gains. The March delivery ended with an advance of 0.16 cent a pound to 14.27 cents, for a two-day gain of 0.3 cent. According to one dealer, Japan said it has only 40,000 tons of sugar remaining to be shipped to it this year by Cuba under current commitments. The announcement was made because of reports Tuesday that Cuba would delay shipments to Japan scheduled for later this year, into early next year. The dealer said the quantity mentioned in the Japanese announcement is so small that it's meaningless. One analyst said he thought the market continued to be supported to some degree by a delay in the Cuban sugar harvest caused by adverse weather. The dealer said India might be the real factor that is keeping futures prices firm. That country recently bought 200,000 tons of sugar and had been expected to seek a like quantity last week but didn't. “It's known they need the sugar, and the expectation that they will come in is apparently giving the market its principal support,” the dealer said.

Before July, pro-choice voters could safely make political decisions without focusing narrowly on abortion. Now, the threat of further restrictions adds a new dimension, bringing an upsurge in political activity by abortion-rights forces. A recent pro-choice rally in Trenton drew thousands, and in a major reversal, Congress is defying a presidential veto and demanding that Medicaid abortions be permitted in cases of rape and incest.

The state quit shoving peasants onto its subsidized farms over 30 years ago. But it never did let up on the pressure. Until recently, a farmer with no heir had to will the state his land to collect his pension. The pension's size still depends on how much produce he sells the state. His allotment of materials also did, until the state couldn't hold up its end of that bargain. Yet the state alone sells seeds and machines. When supplies are short, it often hands them over only in exchange for milk or grain.

There is a great deal to be said, to be sure, for stripping the garbage out of the reconciliation bill.

Besides adding to sales, leathers also attract retailers who may buy furs later, he adds.

Borrowers' incentives are equally skewed. Since the government has a dismal record of collecting bad debts, the costs to the borrower of defaulting are usually low. In addition, it is often possible to obtain a new government loan even if existing debts are not paid off. Simple policy prescriptions in this case would be to improve debt collection (taking the gloves off contracted collection agencies) and to deny new credit to defaulters. These provisions would be difficult to enforce for a program intended to provide a subsidy, but would be reasonable and effective devices for programs that attempt to offset market imperfections.

Even if B.A.T receives approval for the restructuring, the company will remain in play, say shareholders and analysts, though the situation may unfold over the next 12 months, rather than six.

It was during the quiet exodus down the pristine concrete ramps of the Stick that I really understood the point of all those Walkmen and Watchmen.

Increasingly accurate estimates of the severity of the quake became available before I got to my car.

JudgeO'Kicki, a stern and forbidding-looking man, has been a fixture in the local legal community for more than two decades. The son of an immigrant stonemason of Slovenian descent, he was raised in a small borough outside Ebensburg, the Cambria County seat, and put himself through the University of Pittsburgh Law School. He graduated near the top of his class, serving on the school law review with Richard Thornburgh, who went on to become governor of Pennsylvania and, now, U.S. Attorney General. It was also in law school that Mr.O'Kicki and his first wife had the first of seven daughters. He divorced his first wife three years ago and married the daughter of his court clerk.

Mr. Fernandez doesn't take control in New York until January, but already he's roiling the waters. He's attacked the concept of “building tenure,” one of the most disgraceful institutions in American public schools. It means it is virtually impossible to fire or even transfer incompetent principals. Once they are in the building, they stay. One South Bronx principal kept his job for 16 years, despite a serious drinking problem and rarely showing up for work. He was finally given leave when he was arrested for allegedly buying crack.

While the Japanese have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products, the true test for P&G will be in the $4 billion U.S. detergent market, where growth is slow and liquids have gained prominence over powders. The company may have chosen to market the product under the Cheer name since it's already expanded its best-selling Tide into 16 different varieties, including this year's big hit, Tide with Bleach.

Small-business groups also will fight the medical-leave provision of legislation that would expand parental leaves. And they still oppose as too costly an employer-paid health insurance bill sponsored by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) despite his proposal to phase in small business only gradually. There is also worry that the Pepper Commission studying long-term health care will again push lawmakers toward employerpaid solutions. The Section 89 victory could have a downside by making it harder to oppose lawmakers on other health proposals.

I add two others. Republican Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania engaged the nominee in a verbal contest aimed at showing that Mr. Bork was willing to stretch the Constitution in one area (free speech) while remaining rigid in all the others. It achieved a good media play, and enabled Sen. Specter and others to vote against Mr. Bork out of “conscience.” Further ammunition came from left legal theorist Ronald Dworkin, who in the New York Review of Books painted a picture of a constitutional zombie willfully reading his personal prejudices into the Constitution, particularly in the area of “original intent.” The charge of being “outside the mainstream” of legal thought gravely undercut Mr. Bork's scholarly standing, leaving him bleeding on the platform.

A look at a Thursday night practice at St. Mary Abbot church in the Kensington district of London gives an idea of the work involved. Ten shirt-sleeved ringers stand in a circle, one foot ahead of the other in a prize-fighter's stance, each pulling a rope that disappears through a small hole in the high ceiling of the ringing chamber. No one speaks, and the snaking of the ropes seems to make as much sound as the bells themselves, muffled by the ceiling. Totally absorbed, the ringers stare straight ahead, using peripheral vision (they call it “rope-sight”) to watch the other ropes and thus time their pulls.

It's hard to generalize about a reasonable price for puts. But investors should keep in mind, before paying too much, that the average annual return for stock holdings, long-term, is 9% to 10% a year; a return of 15% is considered praiseworthy. Paying, say, 10% for insurance against losses takes a deep bite out of the return.

The limit could range from three years to seven years, depending on the composition of the management team and the nature of its strategic plan. At the end of this period, the poison pill would be eliminated automatically, unless a new poison pill were approved by the then-current shareholders, who would have an opportunity to evaluate the corporation's strategy and management team at that time.

Warner, for its part, maintains that the written agreement prevents Messrs. Guber and Peters from doing anything else in the motion picture business. Warner says in its suit that Sony “has unethically and illegally sought to steal the services of Guber and Peters and injure Warner as a major competitor of Columbia.” Moreover, Warner says, Sony enticed the producers with “unprecedented financial rewards to breach their binding contractual commitments to Warner.” Warner also names in its suit the two producers, Sony Corp. of America Vice Chairman Michael Schulof, and Walter Yetnikoff, head of Sony's CBS Records unit.

A second illustration is supplied by the recent guilty plea entered by Robert Freeman, formerly head of arbitrage at Goldman, Sachs & Co. Essentially, Mr. Freeman had invested heavily in the Beatrice leveraged buy-out, when he was told by another prominent trader, Bernard “Bunny” Lasker, that the deal was in trouble. After placing orders to sell, Mr. Freeman called Martin Siegel, an investment banker at Kidder, Peabody & Co., who was advising on the deal, to confirm these rumors. Mr. Siegel asked Mr. Freeman who his source was and, on hearing that it was Bunny Lasker, responded: “Well, your bunny has a good nose.”

With his recent purchases of USX common stock, Mr. Icahn shattered a three-year-old, unwritten standstill agreement with Mr. Roderick. In 1986, Mr. Roderick adroitly dodged Mr. Icahn's first bullet after the takeover specialist had built up an 11.4% stake. Mr. Roderick did so by having USX redeem a series of guaranteed notes, a move that, in effect, raised the cost of a $7.19 billion Icahn bid by about $3 billion. And he managed to fend off further advances and even strike up an unlikely friendship with the interloper. Over dinners at New York's Sky Club and Links Club restaurants, the steel executive and the big investor talked steel, international trade and thoroughbred horses.

Of course, one option would be for Manville to buy out the trust's shares - which would do little to benefit public stockholders. But the trust, in most cases, is forbidden from seeking a buyer for only its shares before November 1993. And both the trust and Manville are seeking to avoid the bad publicity that, in the asbestos era, tarred the Manville name. Thus, analysts say, the trust is unlikely to do anything that would hurt Manville's other shareholders. “This is a rare case of a company with a big majority holder which will probably act in the interests of the minority holders,” one investor says.

It is now a commonplace that prosecutors are bringing criminal indictments in cases where until a few years ago only a civil action at most would have been brought. Yet it is also axiomatic that the power to create new crimes belongs only to the legislature, and not to courts. Beginning in the early 19th century, with U.S. v. Hudson and Goodwin, the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that a judicial power to declare conduct to be against the public interest and hence criminal, while well established in British law, would usurp legislative authority under the doctrine of separation of powers.

As the transaction was originally structured, about one-third of the PIK debt is due to convert into a 25% stake of RJR equity in 1993, unless 90% of the bond holders decide against conversion. The key factor in the bond holders' decision will undoubtedly be whether the PIK notes that they are holding are more valuable than a 25% equity stake. And that, of course, will depend on just how high RJR is forced to fix the interest rate to get the bonds trading up to par.

The Newport Beach operators also tend to indulge themselves privately. Investigators cite the case of Matthew Valentine, who is currently serving a six-year sentence at Lompoc Federal Prison for his role in Intech Investment Corp., which promised investors returns of as much as 625% on precious metals. Mr. Valentine, who pleaded guilty to five counts of fraud in federal court in Los Angeles, drove a leased Mercedes and lived in an expensive home on Lido Isle, an island in Newport's harbor, according to investigators. With the $3 million received from investors, he took frequent junkets with friends to exotic locales and leased an expensive BMW for his girlfriend, whom he met at the shop where he got his custom-tailored suits. “It's amazing the amount of money that goes up their nose, out to the dog track or to the tables in Las Vegas,” Mr. Katz says.

Ironically, Caltrans this year began working on a second round of seismic reinforcements of freeways around the state, this time wrapping freeway columns in “steel blankets” to reinforce them.

GP Express, an independent airline serving much of Nebraska, estimates that nearly 40% of its revenues come from the subsidies that, in some cases, exceed the cost of a ticket. For example, a passenger can fly from Chardon, Neb., to Denver for as little as $89 to $109, according to prices quoted by the company. But given the few number of users, the cost to the federal government per passenger is estimated at $193, according to House and Senate appropriations committees.

As in the Oct. 13 massacre, yesterday morning's drop was triggered by bad news for speculators in UAL. A UAL statement after the market closed Monday indicated that the airline's board wanted to keep the company independent, effectively crushing hopes of an immediate buy-out. Five minutes before the Big Board opened, a preliminary price was flashed for UAL - somewhere between 135 and 155, a loss of as much as $43 a share from Monday's close.

What really spooked the crowds along Wall Street, however, was the sudden concern that, whatever the reason, the pool of debt capital is drying up. Gray Friday reflects a panic mainly by the takeover arbitragers, rather than the small investor, as their highly margined investments in the “deal” stocks are jeopardized by the unexpected drying up of the lubricant for deal financing.

Proponents maintain that a president would choose to use a line-item veto more judiciously than that. But there may be another problem with the device: Despite all the political angst it would cause, it mightn't be effective in cutting the deficit. Big chunks of the government budget, like the entitlement programs of Social Security and Medicare, wouldn't be affected. Governors have found that they have to use the device sparingly to maintain political comity. And it isn't even clear that some pork-barrel projects can be hit with a line-item veto because they tend to be listed in informal conference reports accompanying spending bills rather than in the official bills themselves.

But Mr. Noriega was convinced the Reagan White House wouldn't act against him, recalls his close ally Jose Blandon, because he had an insurance policy: his involvement with the Contra rebels in Nicaragua. Mr. Blandon says the general allowed the Contras to set up a secret training center in Panama. Mr. Noriega also conveyed intelligence from his spy operation inside the Nicaraguan capital of Managua. And on at least one occasion, in the spring of 1985, he helped arrange a sabotage attack on a Sandinista arsenal in Nicaragua. Although, his help for the Contra cause was limited, it was enough to win him important protectors in the Reagan administration, says Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat who then served on the Senate Intelligence Committee. “Noriega played U.S. intelligence agencies and the U.S. government like a violin,” he says.

Since this treasure chest is too big to fit in a bank vault, it has been turned into one. Months after railway worker Zacharias Lewala first picked up a diamond from the sand in 1908, the German colonialists who controlled Namibia proclaimed a wide swath of the desert - about 200 miles north from the Orange River and 60 miles inland from the Atlantic - a restricted area, a designation normally reserved for military operations. When the Germans lost World War I, they lost Namibia to South Africa and the diamonds to Ernest Oppenheimer, patriarch of Anglo American Corp. and De Beers. Today, no one gets in or out of the restricted area without De Beers's stingy approval.

Birmingham, Ala.: The unusual situation in Birmingham vividly illustrates the divisive consequences of carving out safe districts for racial minorities. In Birmingham, which is 57% black, whites are the minority. Insisting that they are protected by the Voting Rights Act, a group of whites brought a federal suit in 1987 to demand that the city abandon at-large voting for the nine member City Council and create nine electoral districts, including four safe white districts. The white group argued that whites were not fully and fairly represented, because in city-wide elections only black candidates or white candidates who catered to “black interests” could win.

The experience of Princeton\/Newport and initiation of other RICO-forfeiture cases against legitimate businesses taught Drexel that a RICOed investment bank would be an ex-investment bank.

Part of Drexel's plea was to cut Mr. Milken loose. So after all the prosecutorial hoopla no one has established what, if anything, Drexel did wrong.

But Mr. Greenspan remains reluctant to loosen policy, partly because he faces a phalanx of presidents of regional Fed banks who oppose credit easing. In addition, the chairman has a wary eye aimed a year or two down the road. Inflation may be stable at the moment, running at about 4.5%. But if the Fed eases too soon, Mr. Greenspan fears, prices may begin to accelerate again next year. Moreover, if the Fed holds tight, it may be able gradually to reduce inflation, moving toward the zero-inflation goal that the Fed chairman embraced in testimony to Congress last week.

Organizations supporting the constitutional right to abortion filed a friend-of-the-court brief in two Supreme Court cases in behalf of an unprecedented number of groups. The brief, coordinated by the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood Federation of America, was filed in behalf of 274 groups, although many of them were small community religious organizations rather than national in membership. The brief argued that the 1973 decision recognizing the right to abortion, Roe vs. Wade, was correct and shouldn't be reconsidered.

Few small neighborhood businesses, however, can afford such protection, even in collaboration with other local merchants. In the neighborhoods with the highest crime rates, small business generally relies on the public police force for protection. This creates several problems. One is that there are not enough police to satisfy small businesses. The number one proposal for reducing crime in the New York survey was to put more police on foot or scooter patrol, suggested by more than two-thirds of the respondents. Only 22% supported private security patrols funded by the merchants themselves.

The Panamanian affair is only the tip of a more alarming iceberg.

A month ago, when Beatrice first filed to sell debt, the company had planned to offer $200 million of its senior subordinated reset notes at a yield of 12 3\/4%. The $150 million in senior subordinated floating-rate notes were targeted to be offered at a price to float four percentage points above the three-month LIBOR. By October, however, market conditions had deteriorated and the reset notes were targeted to be offered at a yield of between 13 1\/4% and 13 1\/2%.

Another argument of the environmentalists is that if substitutes are available, why not use them? Mr. Teagan cites a list of substitutes but none, so far, match the nonflammable, nontoxic CFCs. Butane and propane can be used as coolants, for example, but are flammable. Moreover, new lubricants will be needed to protect compressors from the new formulations, which, as with CFCs, are solvents. Mr. Teagan points out as well that if the equipment designed to get along without CFCs is less efficient than current devices, energy consumption will rise and that will worsen the greenhouse effect. Folks in the Midwest who just suffered a mid-October snowstorm may wonder where the greenhouse was when they needed it, but let's not be flippant about grave risks.

Having exhausted all modern aids to fertility, Linda and Michael decide to adopt. The actors wear pained expressions to indicate their genuine longing for a little one - or maybe they're not-so-subtly commenting on the inadequacy of the script, and Jonathan Kaplan's (“The Accused”) dull direction. Or maybe they are disgusted by the literal-minded musical score; when a character arrives at a major decision her thoughts are revealed by the sound of “I Can See Clearly Now.” The adoption agency insists on introducing the adopting parents to the birth mother, so Linda and Michael pay for pregnant Lucy's (Ms. Masterson) bus ticket from Ohio. (Why in these movies is the unwed pregnant woman always from Ohio? I ask this not necessarily as a native Ohioan.) Lucy, of course, is pretty and smart, though uneducated. Everyone falls in love with everyone else. There is some pain, when Lucy has the baby and “didn't know she would feel like this” and wants to keep the baby. But in the end, everything turns out for the best, in the film makers' warped view. Like lawyers in the hostile takeover field, the baby goes where the money is.

An accounting controversy at the end of last year forced Boston Co. to admit it had overstated pretax profits by some $44 million. The resulting scandal led to the firing of James N. von Germeten as Boston Co.'s president and to the resignations of the company's chief financial officer and treasurer. The executives were accused of improperly deferring expenses and booking revenue early, in an effort to dress up results - and perhaps bolster performance-related bonuses. Mr. von Germeten, in turn, attributed the controversy to judgmental errors by accountants and accused Shearson of conducting a “witch hunt.”

In addition, investors' desire to hold stocks - directly and through mutual funds - has held surprisingly steady; stocks' importance among assets largely reflects the ups and downs of the stock market, and not a shift in stock-holding preferences. “Stocks have not spread to the general public, despite the fact that the environment is much different,” concludes Robert Avery, an economist at Cornell University. “To me it says that despite all the views that we spend too much of our wealth on paper assets, we have ways of holding wealth similar to 100 years ago.”

Founded as the Examiner in 1903 by Mr. Hearst, the Herald was crippled by a bitter, decade-long strike that began in 1967 and cut circulation in half. Financially, it never recovered; editorially, it had its moments. In 1979, Hearst hired editor James Bellows, who brightened the editorial product considerably. He and his successor, Mary Anne Dolan, restored respect for the editorial product, and though in recent years the paper had been limping along on limited resources, its accomplishments were notable. For example, the Herald consistently beat its much-larger rival on disclosures about Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley's financial dealings. The Herald's sports coverage and arts criticism were also highly regarded.

At 3:55, five minutes before the market closed, the meeting began.

One person who wasn't present: Mr. Wolf himself who, confident that the deal would go through, was returning from Europe, where he had pitched the proposal to several big European banks.

Just last week, for example, Trans World Airlines and Pan Am Corp.'s Pan American World Airways went so far as to offer cash rebates or gift checks of $200 to $1,000 to certain frequent-flier members making trans-Atlantic flights in business class or first class. The industry's slowdown became apparent this month when AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines, reported an 8.8% drop in third-quarter net income and said its fourth quarter would be “disappointing.” Shortly before that, USAir had said its third-quarter results would be “significantly lower” than a year earlier. Yesterday, it provided the details: Its loss of $77.7 million, or $1.86 a share, contrasted with net of $68.5 million, or $1.58 a share, in the 1988 third quarter. Revenue rose only 3.3% in the latest period, to $1.53 billion from $1.48 billion.

Profits of Shell, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch\/Shell Group, tumbled $24 million, or 6.6%, to $340 million, despite a gain of $30 million from an insurance settlement.

Shaving away some of the gain in that unit was a decline in U.S. oil production to 502,000 barrels of oil a day during the quarter from 527,000 barrels a day last year.

CENTRUST SAVINGS BANK (Miami) - Moody's Investors Service Inc. downgraded its ratings on the subordinated debt of CenTrust to Caa from B-3. The rating agency also reduced the ratings for long-term deposits to B-3 from Ba-3 and for preferred stock to Ca from Caa. The rating agency said about $85 million in securities was affected. The downgrades were prompted, Moody's said, by the continuing turmoil in the junk bond market and the suspension of dividends on CenTrust's preferred stock. Moody's also said it believed the proposed sale of 63 CenTrust branches to Great Western Bank could, if completed, endanger the thrift's funding and market position.

Japan's biggest women's underwear maker, Wacoal Corp., said that it developed a sports car that it plans to market in two years. The “Jiotto Caspita” can run at over 188 miles an hour, a company spokesman said. The base price of the car is estimated at 30 million yen (about $213,000).

While people were jingling their change, the LDP politicians were caught in scandals. Money, such as in Recruit's political donations, and women, as in the cases of Prime Minister Sosuke Uno and Secretary General Tokuo Yamashita, seldom have caused political scandals in Japan. Whereas most men were a bit ambivalent about the sex scandals (though they were furious about Recruit), women were upset about both and surged to the polls. In the recent Upper House and Tokyo metropolitan congressional elections, in which the Socialist Party won a runaway victory, 60% of all women voted, as opposed to the usual 40%. It is difficult to analyze how much of their anger was due to Recruit, the sex scandals, or the one-yen coins in their purses, but they obviously were voting to punish the LDP.

What we have before us now is essentially the same program but with more resources plowed into all of the efforts to enforce and control. These efforts wind up creating a market where the price vastly exceeds the cost. With these incentives, demand creates its own supply and a criminal network along with it. It seems to me we're not really going to get anywhere until we can take the criminality out of the drug business and the incentives for criminality out of it. Frankly, the only way I can think of to accomplish this is to make it possible for addicts to buy drugs at some regulated place at a price that approximates their cost. When you do that you wipe out the criminal incentives, including, I might say, the incentive that the drug pushers have to go around and get kids addicted, so that they create a market for themselves. They won't have that incentive because they won't have that market.

South Korea is “critically important to us now, both economically and in terms of security,” says Sen.

Due process still is denied in South Korea; a few months ago, Kim Dae Jung, the major opposition leader, was detained and interrogated for 20 hours by security thugs. Just as Pope John Paul II did in Seoul last week, President Bush and members of Congress ought to tell Mr. Roh in no uncertain terms that this kind of behavior is unacceptable.

The American people and their government also woke up too late to the menace drugs posed to the moral structure of their country. Even now, the American attack upon this tremendous problem is timid in relation to the magnitude of the threat. I can attest that a recent Colombian visitor to the U.S. was offered drugs three times in the few blocks' walk between Grand Central Terminal and the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in midtown Manhattan. Colombia alone - its government, its people, its newspapers - does not have the capacity to fight this battle successfully. All drug-consuming countries must jointly decide to combat and punish the consumers and distributors of drugs. The U.S., as the major drug consumer, should lead this joint effort. Reduction, if not the total cessation, of drug consumption is the requirement for victory.

For now, both companies are keeping quiet about their specific plans. But industry watchers expect them to blend the methodical marketing strategies they use for more mundane products with the more intuitive approach typical of cosmetics companies. Likely changes include more emphasis on research, soaring advertising budgets and aggressive pricing. But some cosmetics-industry executives wonder whether techniques honed in packaged goods will translate to the cosmetics business. Estee Lauder Inc., Revlon Inc. and other cosmetics houses traditionally have considered themselves fashion enterprises whose product development is guided by the creative intuition of their executives. Cosmetics companies roll out new makeup colors several times a year, and since most products can be easily copied by competitors, they're loath to test them with consumers.

Mr. Goldberg says the cost of the earthquake will definitely top $1 billion and could reach $4 billion. He cautions that early damage estimates are often low; the damage totals in Hurricane Hugo increased tenfold as more information was received.

After the 1987 plunge, markets agreed that it would be wise to halt trading whenever panic conditions arose. The New York Stock Exchange adopted two specific circuit breakers: If the Dow Jones index falls 250 points in a day, the exchange will halt trading for one hour; if the decline hits 400 points, the exchange will close for an additional two hours. The rationale is that an interruption of trading will allow investors to reconsider their strategies, calm sellers and lead buyers to enter the market at indicated new price levels.

BRAMALEA Ltd. said it agreed to issue 100 million Canadian dollars (US$85.1 million) of 10.5% senior debentures due Nov. 30, 1999, together with 100,000 bond purchase warrants.

First, the somewhat affected idealism of the 1960s. Then, the all-too-sincere opportunism of the 1970s and 1980s. What now? To judge from novels that mirror the contemporary scene, we're back in the age of anxiety. Where '60s dropouts professed to scorn middle-class life and ambitious yuppies hoped to leave it far behind as they scaled the upper reaches of success, it now seems that so many people feel they're slipping between the cracks, that middle-class life is viewed with nostalgia or outright longing.

INTERPUBLIC ON TV: Interpublic Group said its television programming operations - which it expanded earlier this year - agreed to supply more than 4,000 hours of original programming across Europe in 1990. It said the programs, largely game shows, will be provided by its E.C. Television unit along with Fremantle International, a producer and distributor of game shows of which it recently bought 49%. It said that volume makes it the largest supplier of original TV programming in Europe. Interpublic is providing the programming in return for advertising time, which it said will be valued at more than $75 million in 1990 and $150 million in 1991. It plans to sell the ad time to its clients at a discount. NEW ACCOUNT: CoreStates Financial Corp., Philadelphia, named Earle Palmer Brown & Spiro, Philadelphia, as agency of record for its $5 million account. The business had been handled by VanSant Dugdale, Baltimore.

The project, known as Lotus Mansion, has been mired in controversy. When the loan agreement was announced, it was hailed as one of the first Western-style financing transactions ever used in China. Unlike most loans to China, there was no Chinese guarantor. Instead, the banks secured a promise from state-owned Bank of Communications that it would lend Asia Development the entire $55 million at maturity to finance repayment of the original borrowing. The loan was to have matured in just two to three years, as soon as construction was completed.

PILING ON? Piggybacking on government assertions that General Electric Co. may have covered up fraudulent billings to the Pentagon, two shareholders have filed a civil racketeering suit against the company. The suit was filed by plaintiffs' securities lawyer Richard D. Greenfield in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia. He seeks damages from the company's 15 directors on grounds that they either “participated in or condoned the illegal acts ... or utterly failed to carry out their duties as directors.” GE is defending itself against government criminal charges of fraud and false claims in connection with a logistics-computer contract for the Army. The trial begins today in federal court in Philadelphia. The government's assertions of the cover-up were made in last minute pretrial motions. GE, which vehemently denies the government's allegations, denounced Mr. Greenfield's suit. “It is a cheap-shot suit - procedurally defective and thoroughly fallacious - which was hurriedly filed by a contingency-fee lawyer as a result of newspaper reports,” said a GE spokeswoman. She added that the company was considering bringing sanctions against Mr. Greenfield for making “grossly inaccurate and unsupported allegations.”

The evening ended with Mr. Glass's “Metamorphosis,” another multiple work. Parts 1, 2, and 5 come from the soundtrack of Errol Morris's acclaimed film, “The Thin Blue Line,” and the two other parts from incidental music to two separate dramatizations of the Kafka story of the same name. When used as background in this way, the music has an appropriate eeriness, as when a two-note phrase, a descending minor third, accompanies the seemingly endless litany of reports, interviews and confessions of witnesses in the Morris film. Served up as a solo, however, the music lacks the resonance provided by a context within another medium.

For Ms. Geva, an actress and author who began her career as a dancer during the early days of the Soviet state under her original name of Gevergeyeva, it offers something more: a sense of completion, the lifting of a curtain on the past. A great deal of what is currently on display in New York belonged to her father. These lithographs, designs, programs, photographs, which she pored over day after day, fed her adolescent yearning to join the ballet. Of this ambition her father disapproved, because, he said, dancers weren't properly educated.

Mr. Garber manages to invest this tale of financial wars with the colorful characters and fast-paced action of a suspense novel. And like a spy or mystery story, this novel has strong elements of allegory, as the good and evil forces battle it out. Mr. Garber depicts these moral qualities with the broad brush strokes of a satire that occasionally descends to the realm of cliched caricatures. Standard-issue portraits of flaky Californians, snobbish homosexuals and Neanderthal union leaders undermine the force of the author's perceptions. Yet the heavy-handedness of the satire also can be effective in a book like this: If the head of AIW were not portrayed as an utterly contemptible, malicious dolt, we would not much care whether his schemes were defeated, and would not be so diverted in the process.

But it may be weeks before GEC and its potential partners decide whether to bid, the source indicated. GEC plans first to study Ferranti's financial accounts, which auditors recently said included # 215 million in fictitious contracts at a U.S. unit, International Signal & Control Group, with which Ferranti merged last year. Also, any GEC bid might be blocked by British antitrust regulators; Ferranti is GEC's main competitor on several key defense-electronics contracts, and its purchase by GEC may heighten British Defense Ministry worries about concentration in the country's defense industry. A consortium bid, however, would diminish GEC's direct role in Ferranti and might consequently appease ministry officials.

The mining zone has thus remained one of the most desolate places in Africa. Ghost towns dot the Namib dunes, proving diamonds aren't forever. Oranjemund, the mine headquarters, is a lonely corporate oasis of 9,000 residents. Jackals roam the streets at night, and gemsbok, hardy antelope with long straight horns, wander in from the desert to drink from water sprinklers. On most days, the desert's heat and the cool of the ocean combine to create a mist like a damp rag. The wind, stinging with sand, never seems to stop.

Three novels, “The Beginning and the End” (412 pages, $19.95), “The Thief and the Dogs” (158 pages, $16.95), and “Wedding Song” (174 pages, $16.95), recently published by Doubleday offer an uneven sample of the 77-year-old Mr. Mahfouz's talent. But they do show the range of a restless intellect whose 30-odd novels span five decades and include work of social realism, protest and allegory. They also chart the evolution of a city that has grown tenfold in the author's lifetime, from a colonial outpost of fez-wearing pashas to a Third World slum choking on its own refuse. “Soon it'll be so crowded,” a narrator complains, “that people will start eating each other.”

The delay in getting AZT to children has been blamed on a combination of factors.

This was in contrast with the society's meeting last May, at the height of the controversy, when more than 1,500 scientists, along with scores of reporters and TV crews, crowded into a Los Angeles hotel ballroom for a tumultuous special night session on the subject.

One reason questions surround the heat experiments is that they involve unusually meticulous measurements. Typically, the input energy ranges from a third of a watt to one watt and the excess energy is measured in tenths of a watt. One exception is a continuing experiment at Stanford University where as much as 10 watts of energy are being put into the electrolytic cells. A cell filled with heavy water is producing 1.0 to 1.5 watts more heat than an identical electrolytic cell filled with ordinary water next to it, reported Turgut M. Gur, an associate of materials scientist Robert A. Huggins, head of the Stanford experimental team.

But that may not be possible, because recessions often take investors by surprise. “They always seem to come a bit later than you expect. When they do hit, they hit fast,” says David A.

COTTON: Futures prices eased, more in reaction to Hurricane Jerry than to any influence of the stock market. The December contract ended with a loss of 0.22 cent a pound, at 74.48 cents. Technical considerations following the hurricane, which was a factor in the market Friday, caused prices to decline yesterday, said Ernest Simon, cotton specialist for Prudential-Bache Securities, New York. Prices rose sharply Friday as the storm approached Texas and Louisiana, which is part of the Mississippi Delta cotton-growing area. However, after absorbing the potential effect of the hurricane, prices began to slip late Friday, Mr. Simon said. That selling continued yesterday and kept prices under pressure, he said. Colder weather is being predicted for the high plains of Texas and the northern states of the Delta during the coming weekend, Mr. Simon said. That hasn't yet captured traders' attention, he added.

Japanese air-conditioner maker Daikin Industries Ltd. was fined two million yen ($14,000) for exporting to the Soviet Union a chemical solution that could be used in missile-guidance systems. A Daikin executive in charge of exports when the high-purity halogenated hydrocarbon was sold to the Soviets in 1986 received a suspended 10-month jail sentence. Judge Masaaki Yoneyama told the Osaka District Court Daikin's “responsibility is heavy because illegal exports lowered international trust in Japan.” Sale of the solution in concentrated form to Communist countries is prohibited by Japanese law and by international agreement.

Mr. Greenspan said the inflation rate, currently about 4 1\/2%, “could be brought down to levels which are close to zero without putting the economy into a recession, but I do suspect that there might be some modest loss of economic output.” In other words, economic growth would be lower and unemployment would be higher for a few years.

We badly need to follow fact rather than the rhetoric of conventional wisdom.

Beef prices, hovering near records since the drought, could drop in earnest this winter if ranchers expand herds. Lower feed prices may help animals eat more cheaply, but humans have to factor in an expensive middleman: the processor. Food companies probably won't cut their prices much, blaming other costs. “Labor takes the biggest single chunk out of the “food dollar,”” says Frank Pankyo of the Food Institute.

This species of congressional action is predicated on an interpretation of the appropriations clause that is erroneous and unconstitutional. The appropriations clause states that “No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law ....” The prevailing interpretation of the clause on Capitol Hill is that it gives Congress an omnipresent veto over every conceivable action of the president through the ability to withhold funding. This interpretation was officially endorsed by Congress in 1987 in the Iran-Contra Report.

Britain and all of Europe need to reconsider the prospects for European integration in light of the possible reunification and neutralization of Germany. A unified Germany that remained within the Western alliance would give Germany such an overshadowing position that all other members of a unified Europe would become vassals of the German state. Unless the Soviet Union collapses, German reunification is likely to require Germany's neutralization. The implications for Britain, France and the rest of Europe of having their currencies tied to the economic policy of a neutral country need considering before we judge Mr. Lawson's resignation to be unfortunate.

Ignoring the FHA losses, a few of my colleagues have pushed for expansion of FHA mortgage guarantees by including wealthier home purchasers in the program. The National Affordable Housing Act (Cranston-D'Amato), introduced earlier this year, erases the current mortgage guarantee ceiling of $101,250 and places a “floating cap” at 95% of the median home price in higher-cost areas.

It is extraordinary that the British Treasury thought it could prevent a trade deficit by inflating the pound. The British balance-of-payments statistics show that after the top tax rate was cut to 40%, the flow abroad of British capital slowed, to 50 billion pounds ($79 billion at the current rate) in 1988 from 93 billion pounds in 1986. This change in the British capital account required an offsetting change in the trade account, a change that could not be prevented by pegging the currency.

The amendment prompted an ironic protest from Mr. Thurmond, who complained that it would “kill” capital punishment. A large number of studies suggest that state judges and juries have imposed the penalty in a racially discriminatory fashion. And the Kennedy amendment would invade not only federal but state sentencings, in two important ways. It would allow all defendants to introduce statistical evidence showing racially disproportionate application of the death penalty in the past. And it would shift the burden to prosecutors to disprove that discrimination caused any statistical racial disparities.

LIMITED RISK FUNDS: These guarantee protection against stock market declines while still passing along most gains. Here a fund may promise to pay back, say, $95 of every $100 invested for a year, even if the market goes much lower. The fund could invest $87 for one year in Treasury bills yielding 8% to return the guaranteed $95. That leaves $13, which could be used to buy S&P 500 options that will nearly match any gain in the S&P index.

His early promises to make India a modern nation remain bogged down in bloated bureaucracy. His pledge to clean up local administration and Indian politics, including his own party, went unfulfilled. His “Mr. Clean” image was muddied by an arms-kickback scandal, which will be a major campaign issue. Some analysts predict that disappointment in Mr. Gandhi's spent pledge to reduce corruption and heavy-handed local government will crest at the polls. “There's a wide feeling of indignation across the country,” says Bhabani Sen Gupta of the Center for Policy Research, in New Delhi. “I think the people will be judging the regime by a petty policeman, by a corrupt revenue collector. This could be a big protest against an administrative failure.”

During the first hour of trading yesterday, prices fell as much as 1\/4 point, or down about $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount. But market activity was energized as investors started to view the lower price levels as attractive. And the Treasury's $17.6 billion auction of short-term bills, which generated strong buying interest, helped to lift the bond market out of the doldrums.

While it's an astonishing achievement for the Nakhamkin gallery to have organized the show in only three months, the time has surely come to present this kind of material in ways that reveal a context and a point of view. Even the title is misleading: The exhibition covers ballet, not in Russia, but only in what is now Leningrad. It also begins before 1830 and ends after 1930. In compiling the catalog, the gallery has missed a great opportunity to document a lot of rare material. Though well-illustrated, the publication is uninformative and often simply untrustworthy. Clearly, no dance lover should skip the show, but it's only a stopgap for the serious, scholarly endeavor we really need.

Meanwhile, the big players haven't tried to copy the NEC standard. Corporate pride as well as the close ties common among Japanese manufacturers help explain why.

The most likely winner will be the Marxist-dominated SWAPO rebels. The U.S. journalist's “crime” was writing that the head of the commission charged with overseeing the election's fairness, BryanO'Linn, was openly sympathetic to SWAPO. Shortly after that, Mr.O'Linn had Scott Stanley arrested and his passport confiscated. Mr. Stanley is on trial over charges that he violated a proclamation, issued by the South African administrator general earlier this year, which made it a crime punishable by two years in prison for any person to “insult, disparate or belittle” the election commission.

Growth was also a consideration in Dallas. The Times Herald's circulation had been slipping for several years, and its audited daily circulation now stands at 222,000, compared with the Morning News's 370,000.

Plans call for the two to explore TV programming drawn from the syndicate's and others' characters, as well as to develop TV ads for newspapers using Universal's characters.

But the heated fight over program trading is about much more than a volatile stock market. The real battle is over who will control that market and reap its huge rewards. Program trading itself, according to many academics who have studied it, is merely caught in the middle of this battle, unfairly labeled as the evil driving force of the marketplace.

One old building, the Golden State Bank Building on Front Street, had its yellow brick facade sheared off by the shock of the quake, leaving a wedge of its third floor open to the air, while piles of dusty bricks tumbled to the street below narrowly missing rush-hour pedestrians and cars. Reinforcing such old building stock, Mr. Johnson said, “comes down to money. It's a danger. We know it's there. And sooner or later, we have to do something about it.”

BellSouth Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John L. Clendenin said three factors accounted for the drop in third-quarter earnings. The refinancing of $481 million in long-term debt reduced net income by $22 million, or five cents a share, but in the long run will save more than $250 million in interest costs. The company previously said that the recent acquisition of Mobile Communications Corp. of America would dilute 1989 earnings by about 3%. In addition, earnings were reduced by rate reductions in Florida, Kentucky, Alabama, Tennessee and Louisiana.

Even if Mr. Crandall is correct, he of all people must realize our society relies on competition to keep prices at a competitive level.

When I asked American Airlines for its side of the story for use in my MBA class, where I teach business ethics, it did not respond. Perhaps the ethics of an industry's leader filters down and is one of the factors that ultimately shapes consumer trust in that industry.

GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Soybean and corn futures prices moved higher on the strength of buying from commodity pool managers trying to profit from technical price trends, as well as continued export strength. A leveling off of farmer selling tied to the harvest also removed some of the downward pressure on futures contract prices. Wheat futures prices fell, however, at least partly in reaction to the rumored selling of futures contracts equal to several million bushels of wheat by commodity speculator Richard Dennis. Neither Mr. Dennis nor officials of his Chicago trading company, C&D Commodities, could be reached for comment. As for corn and soybean futures, “a lot of commission house buying this morning and computer-driven buying” supported prices in early trading, said Steven Freed, a futures analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. Soybean futures for November delivery gained 5.25 cents a bushel to close at $5.66 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. December corn futures added 2.25 cents a bushel to close at $2.4225 a bushel on the Board of Trade. Announced and anticipated purchases from foreign countries are also supporting futures prices. “Russian ships are arriving in the gulf and there isn't enough grain in the pipeline,” said Katharina Zimmer, a futures analyst with Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York. The Soviet Union has purchased roughly eight million tons of grain this month, and is expected to take delivery by year end, analysts said.

COCOA: Futures prices dropped again, extending the declining trend. The December contract settled at $961 a metric ton, off $38. The contract's low point yesterday, $956, was both a life-of-contract low and a 14-year low price for cocoa. The decline was apparently sparked by rumors that the Ivory Coast, a major African producer, sold 20,000 tons in London on Wednesday. Mr.O'Neill said the market is so fragile and weak that it can't absorb any selling. Bert Ruiz, soft commodity specialist at Balfour, Maclaine Futures Inc., said that all week he has seen increasing open interest and declining prices - an almost certain sign that additional selling of contracts is taking place. Open interest is the number of outstanding contracts that remain to be settled either by an opposite trade or delivery. “I think trade interests are hedging their physical cocoa with new sales,” he said. He also pointed out that the volume on Wednesday was 8,839 contracts, which for cocoa is extremely heavy. Mr. Ruiz said that the producers of cocoa have no choice but to sell their stocks because of their need for hard currencies. He believes that the major cocoa buyers are well aware of the sad state of the market and are taking advantage of the weakening prices by doing “scale-down buying.” That is, they mostly buy just enough cocoa to satisfy their current needs - a common strategy in a falling market.

As the leading candidate for president of his country in next year's election, Mario Vargas Llosa ought to be in an enviable position. But his country is Peru, where political visibility, especially for a believer in democracy and free enterprise - a right winger in Latin American eyes - makes a man a target for assassination. For almost any Peruvian these days, to show an interest in public office is a heroic gesture; for Mr. Vargas Llosa especially so, since he already has achieved a high position in the world's eyes as a writer. Published everywhere to universal acclaim, doted on like a movie star in the Hispanic world from Barcelona to Ushuaia, Mr. Vargas Llosa could live comfortably on his royalties and console his political conscience with the thought that Peru is a hopeless mess not of his making and that he already did his best to reform it with his magnificently cinematic novel about the years of military dictatorship of his youth, “Conversation in the Cathedral.”

Adding insult to injury, United's 25,000-member Machinists' union, which helped scuttle financing for the first bid, yesterday asked UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf and other UAL directors to resign. A similar demand was made by a group that represents some of United's 26,000 noncontract employees. John Peterpaul, Machinists union general vice president, attacked Mr. Wolf as “greedy and irresponsible” for pursuing the buy-out. Although Mr. Wolf and John Pope, UAL's chief financial officer, stood to pocket $114.3 million for stock and options in the buy-out, UAL executives planned to reinvest only $15 million in the new company.

Like Peter Sellars, Ms. Bogart manipulates her actors as if they were rag dolls, sprawling them on staircases, dangling them off tables, even hanging them from precipices while having them perform some gymnastic feats of derring-do. There are moments in this “Summerfolk” when the characters populating the vast multilevel country house (which looks like a parody of Frank Lloyd Wright and is designed by Victoria Petrovich) spout philosophic bon mots with the self-conscious rat-a-tat-tat pacing of “Laugh In.” “Talk hurts from where it spurts,” one of them says. The clash of ideologies survives this treatment, but the nuance and richness of Gorky's individual characters have vanished in the scuffle. As for the humor that Gorky's text provides, when repainted in such broad strokes (particularly by the lesser members of the ensemble) it looks and sounds forced.

The order against assassinations is another artifact of the same congressional mind-set, a product of the 1970s Vietnam syndrome against any executive action. President Bush would do himself and the country a favor by rescinding the order as an ambiguous intrusion on his ability to defend America's national security. There are of course good reasons the U.S. shouldn't get into the assassination business, but rescinding the executive order is not the same thing as saying the U.S. should start passing out exploding cigars. The world being the nasty place it is, we want Presidents to have the freedom to order operations in which someone might get killed. In such situations, you can not write rules in advance, you can only make sure the President takes the responsibility.

COMPUTER chips that simulate human vision have been developed by Japan's Sharp Corp. They mimic the brain by “looking” at an image, extracting the fundamentals - boundaries, corners and lines - and translating them into computer data. Sharp says the set of chips could improve fax machines, graphics computers or identification systems that recognize facial features .... An N.V. Philips unit has created a computer system that processes video images 3,000 times faster than conventional systems. Using reduced instruction-set computing, or RISC, chips made by Intergraph of Huntsville, Ala., the system splits the image it “sees” into 20 digital representations, each processed by one chip.

Mr. Meek said his suspicions were aroused by several foreign investments by Lincoln, including $22 million paid to Credit Suisse of Switzerland, an $18 million interest in Saudi European Bank in Paris, a $17.5 million investment in a Bahamas trading company, and a recently discovered holding in a Panama-based company, Southbrook Holdings. Mr. Bickwit said, “I can see why an S&L examiner would regard these as unusual activities,” but said the overseas investments “essentially broke even” for the S&L.

The administration and Congress have lately tangoed around the idea of sending military aid to Cambodia's non-communists. But now the possibility of “diplomatic movement” (Vietnam's withdrawal, the Baker initiative) has put that plan on hold, with the proviso that if the going got rough, the U.S. would then rearm the opposition. Why the timidity? At the very least, the odds are heavily weighted against the prospects of preventing the Khmer Rouge and Cambodia's communists from ultimately moving against their opponents. When that day comes, it would be particularly awful to know that the United States sat on military aid and deprived these people of the means to settle their fate with at least a little honor.

But that's not how Sen. Roth and his allies look at it. First, they would allow people with old-fashioned IRAs to shift the money to the new ones as long as they pay tax - at today's lower tax rates - on the previously deducted contributions.

The hacker was pawing over the Berkeley files but also using Berkeley and other easily accessible computers as stepping stones to the network of computers used by the military and national security agencies.

These A's, however, got few grades as low as B on their 1989 report card. They led the Major Leagues in regular-season wins with 99 and flattened the Toronto Blue Jays four games to one for the American League pennant before stomping their cross-bay rivals. The pithiest testimony to their domination of the just-concluded tournament came from Giants' manager Roger Craig after his team had fallen in Game Three to a five-home-run barrage that tied a 61-year-old Series record. Asked what he would do differently on the morrow, Craig allowed that he might play his outfielders deeper, “maybe on the other side of the fence.”

ABORTION RULING UPHELD: A federal appeals court upheld a lower court ruling that the U.S. can bar the use of federal funds for family-planning programs that include abortion-related services. A Department of Health and Human Services rule adopted in 1988 prohibits the use of so-called Title X funds for programs that assist a woman in obtaining an abortion, such as abortion counseling and referrals. The rule also prohibits funding for activities that “encourage, promote or advocate abortion.” Title X funds are the single largest source of federal funding for family-planning services, according to the opinion by the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York. The panel ruled that the restrictions don't violate the freedom of speech of health care providers and that the limits on counseling services don't violate the rights of pregnant women.

COPPER: The selling that started on Friday continued yesterday. The December contract fell 3.85 cents a pound to $1.1960. London Metal Exchange warehouse stocks were down only 4,800 metric tons for the week to 84,500 tons; expectations late last week were a drop of 10,000 to 15,000 tons. The New York market made its high for the day on the opening and when it dropped below the $1.23-a-pound level, selling picked up as previous buyers bailed out of their positions and aggressive short sellers - anticipating further declines - moved in. Fund selling also picked up at that point. According to Bernard Savaiko, senior commodity analyst at PaineWebber, the only stability to the market came when short sellers periodically moved in to cover their positions by buying contracts. This activity produced small rallies, which in turn attracted new short selling. Mr. Savaiko noted that copper had a steep fall in spite of a weak dollar, which would normally support the U.S. copper market. Such support usually comes from arbitragers who use a strong British pound to buy copper in New York. “The sell-off would probably have been worse if the dollar had been strong,” he said. Copper has been stuck in a trading range of $1.19 to $1.34. Mr. Savaiko believes that if copper falls below the bottom of this range the next significant support level will be about $1.04.

Then, to make matters worse, computerized sell programs kicked in, hammering stocks into steeper losses. There was heavy stock-index arbitrage, as traders sold big baskets of stock and bought stock-index futures to profit from the price discrepancies between the two markets. This was a hangover from Friday, when Standard & Poor's 500-stock index futures had closed at a sharp discount to stocks. The onslaught of the program selling dashed any hopes that some of the big program trading firms would hold off until the market stabilized. They didn't. The Dow accelerated its slide, losing 63.52 in the first 40 minutes of trading.

In its nicely produced publication “Where Will Our Children Live?” the NAHB does acknowledge that “of course, the full measure of housing affordability can not be provided by the federal government.” It points to the pernicious impact of local government regulation, particularly zoning and building fees, which pushes the price of housing out of the reach of low- and middle-income people. But while the NAHB has suggested actions that states and localities should take to reduce regulatory barriers, the association has proposed no activist legislative program - comparable to, say, its detailed request for more federal subsidies - to eliminate counterproductive controls.

In fact, because communism seems to be beating a global retreat, some conservatives may simply be so pleased that their anti-communist philosophy is prevailing that they don't have the fire at the moment to push controversial programs. “The short of it is that the most hard-bitten among us can not get into too sour a mood with communism collapsing,” says Mitchell Daniels, a former Reagan White House aide who now is president of the Hudson Institute.

The government currently is subsidizing an estimated 23,000 loans above 11% under the 235 program, and however disruptive to private investors, the refinancing is expected to yield at least $15 million in savings in fiscal 1990. This sum has been guarded jealously by appropriators anxious to offset spending elsewhere, and conservative Sen. Phil Gramm cast the fight as a populist stand against monied interests. “We are stewards here, not of the mortgage companies, but the taxpayers,” said the Texas Republican.

The writer and executive producer of “Settle the Score,” Steve Sohmer, is a graduate of Yale who participated in a PBS documentary, aired this summer, in which six members of the Yale class of 1963 ruminated about their lives since graduation. At one point in the documentary, Mr. Sohmer, who is Jewish, says he felt rejected by many of the Protestants and Southerners he met at Yale. He quotes one student saying, “You're just the kind of Jewboy we Southerners can't stand.” Mr. Sohmer confesses that it was partly in response to such attitudes that he is now “a dweller on one of the two islands off the coast of America.” But is exile in Hollywood enough? Not to judge by “Settle the Score,” in which Mr. Sohmer seems to be settling a score of his own. Of all the unflattering portraits of small-town America I've seen on TV, this film is the most gratuitously nasty. The sole sympathetic character is the prodigal daughter Kate (Jaclyn Smith), and she is tolerable only by virtue of having nothing in common with her kinfolk, a truly benighted pack of Southern Protestants whose grim existence consists mostly of growing peaches and repressing sex.

According to a detailed report by Zbigniew Bochniarz of the University of Minnesota's Hubert Humphrey Institute, 27 areas containing a third of Poland's population are regarded as “ecological hazards” due to multiple violations of standards. Norms are consistently exceeded at 60% of nitrogen oxide monitoring sites and 80% of those for dust and soot emissions. Four-fifths of Poland's soils have become highly acidified; 70% of its southern forests are projected to die by century's end. Between 1965 and 1985, Polish waters fit for human consumption dropped from 33% to 6% of all surface waters, while those unfit even for industry use nearly doubled.

Creative accounting is a hallmark of federal credit. Many agencies roll over their debt, paying off delinquent loans by issuing new loans, or converting defaulted loan guarantees into direct loans. In any case, they avoid having to write off the loans. Some agencies simply keep bad loans on the books; as late as 1987, the Export-Import Bank held in its portfolio at face value loans made to Cuba in the 1950s. More seriously, FmHA has carried several billion dollars of defaulted loans at face value. Until GAO's recent audit, FHA books had not been subject to a complete external audit in 15 years.

The resistance lacks not only air power, armor and expertise but often such essentials as maps, mine detectors, or even winter gloves. Experienced resistance commanders wanted to use guerrilla action and siege tactics to wear down the regime. Instead, they were pressured by Pakistan's ISI, the channel for their support, into attacking Jalalabad. They took more than 25% casualties; journalists report that they faced minefields without mine detectors. The wonder is not that the resistance has failed to topple the Kabul regime, but that it continues to exist and fight at all.

He established his reputation as a freespender in January last year at Sotheby's auction of the Linda and Gerald Guterman collection in New York. There, on one of his first shopping trips, Mr. Paul picked up several paintings at stunning prices. He paid $2.2 million, for instance, for a still life by Jan Jansz. den Uyl that was expected to fetch perhaps $700,000. The price paid was a record for the artist. (Some 64% of items offered at the Guterman auction were sold, at an average price of $343,333. The rest were withdrawn for lack of acceptable bids.)

The question of segregated schools, in Brown vs. Board of Education, was such an issue. In our time abortion has become another, best left to a line of Supreme Court decisions rather than to the chaos of 50 state legislatures. A reflective and growing consensus of Americans clearly wishes to apply the right to privacy in contraceptive matters (decided in the Griswold case) to abortion as well. One can understand Mr. Bork's fear that the new right to privacy will become intolerably stretched, though a Supreme Court composed of men and women with realism, guts and a sense of limits should be able to manage it. What is certain is that if Americans allow another happening like the degrading Bork confirmation circus, it will be at their peril.

In quoting from our research you emphasized the high prevalance of mental illness and alcoholism. You did not note that the homeless people we examined had a multitude of physical disorders in addition to their psychiatric problems and substance abuse. They suffered from malnutrition, chest diseases, cardiovascular disorders, skin problems, infectious diseases and the aftereffects of assaults and rape. Homeless people not only lack safety, privacy and shelter, they also lack the elementary necessities of nutrition, cleanliness and basic health care. In a recent report, the Institute of Medicine pointed out that certain health problems may predispose a person to homelessness, others may be a consequence of it, and a third category is composed of disorders whose treatment is difficult or impossible if a person lacks adequate shelter. The interactions between health and homelessness are complex, defying sweeping generalizations as to “cause” or “effect.”

Wafaa El-Sadr, who heads the AIDS program at New York City's Harlem Hospital Center, can't find help. “I've been recruiting every single day since it's been identified that many AIDS patients come from the inner city,” she says. She was the only staff physician available to treat AIDS patients last summer and now she has the help of only two doctors part time. Part of the problem, though, may reflect a general unwillingness to work with the urban poor.

While Steppenwolf was in London with “The Grapes of Wrath,” Bruce Sagan, the president of its board of directors, quietly returned to Chicago to buy a piece of real estate in the city's rapidly reviving North Halsted Street restaurant and theater district.

The troupe currently performs in a converted dairy that seats 211 and provides little capacity for staging anything beyond a simple one-set production. “If we wanted to stage “Death of a Salesman,” “Mr. Sagan says, “Willie Loman would have to live in a ranch house because of the low ceiling.”

For example, we'll bet you thought that the stock market crashed two years ago. Wrong. According to some of the grand panjandrums of the market, it never happened. In their lexicon the 508-point collapse in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Oct. 19, 1987, was just a big blip. Trotting out a much-beloved Streetspeak term, New York Stock Exchange Chairman John Phelan recently declared that history would record the event as only “a major technical correction.”

What Mr. Major and Mrs. Thatcher will do now remains to be seen. They confront stubborn inflation and a sagging economy, that is to say, stagflation. This can not be solved by provoking a further downturn; reducing the supply of goods does not solve inflation. Our advice is this: Immediately return the government surpluses to the economy through incentive-maximizing tax cuts, and find some monetary policy target that balances both supply and demand for money (which neither aggregates nor interest rates can do). This was the version of supply-side economics that, in the late 1970s and early '80s, worked in America and world-wide to solve a far more serious stagflation than afflicts Britain today.

After four years, though, the South Gardens design is 100% uncollaborated Jennifer Bartlett. She has done little more than recycle her standard motifs - trees, water, landscape fragments, rudimentary square houses, circles, triangles, rectangles - and fit them into a grid, as if she were making one of her gridded two-dimensional works for a gallery wall. But for South Gardens, the grid was to be a 3-D network of masonry or hedge walls with real plants inside them. In a letter to the BPCA, kelly\/varnell called this “arbitrary and amateurish.” The landscape architects were expelled from the garden in July.

Many other factors played a part in yesterday's comeback. The Federal Reserve signaled its willingness to provide liquidity; the interest rate on its loans to major banks inched downward early in the day. Foreign stock markets, which kicked off Black Monday with a huge selling spree, began the day off by relatively modest amounts. The dollar, after falling sharply in overnight trading to 139.10 yen, bounced back strongly to 141.8, thus easing fears that foreigners would unload U.S. stocks.

Program trading has taken off in Japan since last year's introduction of home-market stock-index futures trading on the Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges. But regulators are wary. They haven't forgotten the leap in share prices last Dec. 7, when the first bout of foreign-led index arbitrage drove stocks skyward in the last half-hour of trading, startling regulators who thought they had written enough rules to prevent such a swing. Japan's Finance Ministry had set up mechanisms to limit how far futures prices could fall in a single session and to give market operators the authority to suspend trading in futures at any time. “Maybe it wasn't enough,” a Finance Ministry official noted after the Dec. 7 surge. Japan's regulators have since tightened controls on index-related stock purchases.

These are long-term Richter readings on American capitalism. The whole structure is extremely shaky. Governments have become sophisticated in handling moments of panic (a word the London Times forbade my father to use when he was reporting the Wall Street crash in 1929). But sophistication has its limits. The S&L bailout could cost $300 billion, computing interest on the government's loans. These are real costs. Under what weights will the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation totter? Capitalism may now be engineered to withstand sudden shocks, but there are fault lines - the crisis in profits, the assault on wages, the structural inequity of the system - that make fools of those who claim that the future is here and that history is over.

In this case, the new recipe for national service called for throwing many assorted legislative leftovers into one kettle: a demonstration project for educational aid (particularly satisfying to the DLC and Sen.

The emphasis on market share is evident at Daikin Industries Ltd., Japan's biggest maker of industrial air conditioners. Seeing new office buildings sprout up and its sales soar, Daikin is building another plant, which will lift its production capacity 50%.

Besides, Daikin's major competitors, Hitachi Ltd. and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., “are all adding production lines,” a Daikin spokesman says. “Until now, we were trying to increase productivity with the facilities we already had.

At this week's New York City bond sale, traders expect yields on the 20-year New York bonds to nearly match the 7.9% yield on 30-year Treasury bonds. For an investor in the 28% federal tax bracket, 7.9% tax-free is the same as 10.38% on a taxable investment. That's a taxable-equivalent yield nearly three percentage points more than the current yield on 30-year Treasury bonds. How quickly things change. This past summer, investors' appetite for municipal bonds seemed insatiable. Individuals eager for tax-free income drove up bond prices, making state and local government debt one of the best-performing types of fixed-income investments during the period.
