Some may be tempted to argue that the idea of a strategic review merely resurrects the infamous Zero-Based Budgeting (ZBB) concept of the Carter administration. But ZBB did not involve the strategic planners in the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and therefore degenerated into a bean-counting drill driven by budget politics. Anyway, ZBB's procedures were so cumbersome that everyone involved was crushed under a burden of marginalia. A strategic review is fundamentally different. It would be run by the joint chiefs under simple directions: Produce the best possible force for each budget scenario and provide the Secretary of Defense with a comprehensive net assessment of how that force could be used to achieve U.S. goals.

The Butler, Wis., manufacturer went public at $15.75 a share in August 1987, and Mr. Sim's goal then was a $29 per-share price by 1992.

And some movies seem to have been hurt by their inattention. Warner executives blame Mr. Guber's and Mr. Peters's lack of involvement in “Caddyshack II” for casting and production problems and the film's ultimate dismal failure. “We've had a few bombs,” admits Mr. Peters. “But by and large this company has only been profitable.” He says his company's prowess at packaging and marketing “is why we'll be good at Columbia. We practically ran our own studio.” Longtime Hollywood associates describe Mr. Guber as the intellectual powerhouse of the two, a man with a flair for deal-making and marketing. “Peter is a major piece of Hollywood manpower who has really earned his success,” says Robert Bookman, an agent at Creative Artists Agency. Mark Johnson, the producer of “Rainman,” chimes in: “He has a great ability to hire terrific people and delegate authority .... It's no accident that they've been able to develop such successful material.”

Since the summer, soft-drink companies have been trying to extract themselves from a price-slashing war designed to steal market share from each other. The battle drove up volumes for several years, but the discounted prices have squeezed bottlers' profit margins. Because raw material costs have been escalating and because Coke and Pepsi have become bigger owners of bottling businesses, the companies have been raising soda pop prices in recent months.

PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices were moderately higher as gold gave up some of its early gains and platinum behaved independently, first falling and then later rising. Silver performed quietly. The spot October gold price rose $4 to $367.30 an ounce. The more active December delivery gold settled with a gain of $3.90 an ounce at $371.20, after trading as high as $374. December silver was up 2.3 cents an ounce at $5.163. Platinum behaved more like an industrial metal, easing early on concern over a possible weaker economy, but recovering later, as the stock market strengthened. Gold was nowhere the spectacular performer it was two years ago on Black Monday. For one thing, last Friday, precious metals markets closed before the stock market went into its late-in-the-day nose dive, so it couldn't react to it. Back on Friday, Oct. 16, l987, the stock market declined during the day, and gold prices surged as the stock market fell. The October 1987 contract that day rose as much as $8.70 to as high as $471.60, and the more deferred positions, due to mature as late as March 1989, rose as much as $9.60. On Black Monday, Oct. 19, 1987, the October contract tacked on further gains, rising to as high as $491.50 for a gain of almost $20 on top of the Friday advances, before giving up almost $10 of that at the close. Yesterday's October gain of $4 was miniscule compared with that. One analyst, Peter Cardillo of Josephthal & Co., New York, said the gold market already had some good price-supporting technical factors that would have caused prices to rise, with or without the stock market. “What the stock market did was cause the rise to take place earlier than it would have happened,” said Mr. Cardillo. There's a good chance that gold will retain its gains and rise further, he said. He expects a drop in interest rates, which would help gold by keeping the dollar from rising. Finally, according to Mr. Cardillo, the impact of the strong dollar should be reflected in reduced exports in the August merchandise trade deficit, when the figures are released today. This would be damaging to the dollar and supportive for gold, he said.

“We aren't Philip Morris Cos.,” says Bertrand de Galle, chairman of government-owned Societe Nationaled'Exploitation Industrielle des Tabacs & Allumettes S.A., known as Seita.

Although the smoking provision has attracted the most public interest, the underlying bill was the subject of behind-the-scenes lobbying because of its impact on air transportation and the more mundane, but politically important, projects of members. In a stark lesson in the power of the appropriations committees, the House deliberately killed a handful of projects backed by lawmakers in Florida, Illinois and Pennsylvania who had voted against the panel leadership on the House floor. “Anybody can vote as they want,” said Rep.

Corresponding to the fall in profit rates was - in the early 1980s - the drop in the number arrived at if you divide the market value of firms by the replacement costs of their assets, the famous Q ratio associated with Prof. James Tobin. In theory, the value attached to a firm by the market and the cost of replacing its assets should be the same. But of course the market could decide that the firm's capital stock - its assets - means nothing if the firm is not producing profits. This is indeed what the market decided. By 1982 the ratio was 43.5%, meaning that the market was valuing every dollar's worth of the average firm's assets at 43 cents.

LTV confirmed the price-increase plan, saying the move is designed to more accurately reflect the value of products and to put steel on more equal footing with other commodities. A spokesman for LTV Steel, which is a unit of Dallas-based LTV Corp., noted that steel prices, adjusted for inflation, increased only 1.7% between 1981 and the fourth quarter of 1988, while the prices of other industrial commodities increased nearly five times as much. At the same time, steelmakers are trying to invest more to modernize technology and make themselves more competitive.

Faced with a similar situation, Paul Volcker let the dollar soar, (though monetary aggregates also grew so rapidly monetarists issued egg-on-the-face warnings of inflation). But this devastated the U.S. manufacturing sector, laying the seeds of protectionism. Mr. Lawson, though not allowed to join the EMS, chose to “shadow” the deutsche mark. He reaped inflation along with rapid growth, no doubt validating Sir Alan's predictions in the Prime Minister's mind. But more recently, the pound has been falling with high inflation, which has also seemed almost impervious to the high interest rates Mr. Lawson deployed to stop it.

The Spanish author Camilo Jose Cela won the Nobel Prize for literature yesterday, a surprising choice, but given the Swedish Academy's past perversities, hardly the most undeserved and ridiculous accolade handed out by the awarding committee. In Spain, anyway, the 73-year-old Mr. Cela enjoys some renown for the novels and travel books he wrote during the parched Franco years, the everyday poverty and stagnant atmosphere of which he described in brutally direct, vivid prose, beginning with “The Family of Pascal Duarte” (1942).

That level of production isn't of much concern as long as demand continues strong, analysts said.

ABC hasn't had much luck with shows featuring blacks in recent years, and the producers of one new arrival are a bit desperate. “Homeroom,” a show about a black ad executive who gives up the boardroom for a fourth-grade classroom, is flunking the ratings test. So producers Alyce and Topper Carew spun their Rolodexes and gathered names of black opinion makers to mount a direct-mail campaign.

The new goal of the Voting Rights Act - more minorities in political office - is laudable. For the political process to work, all citizens, regardless of race, must feel represented. One essential indicator that they are is that members of minority groups get elected to public office with reasonable frequency. As is, blacks constitute 12% of the population, but fewer than 2% of elected leaders. But racial gerrymandering is not the best way to accomplish that essential goal.

- Most important of all, schools should have principals with a large measure of authority over the faculty, the curriculum, and all matters of student discipline. Study after study - the most recent from the Brookings Institution - tells us that the best schools are those that are free of outside interference and are governed by a powerful head. With that authority, of course, goes an unambiguous accountability. Schools that are structured in this way produce students with higher morale and superior academic performance. This is a fact - though, in view of all the feathers that are ruffled by this fact, it is not surprising that one hears so little about it.

Mr. Phelan has had difficulty convincing the public that the Big Board is serious about curbing volatility, especially as the exchange clearly relishes its role as the home for $200 billion in stock-index funds, which buy huge baskets of stocks to mimic popular stock-market indexes like the Standard & Poor's 500, and which sometimes employ program trading. The Big Board wants to keep such index funds from fleeing to overseas markets, but only as long as it “handles it intelligently,” Mr. Phelan said.

Mr. Laband gives us an idea why economists' predictions are usually wrong. They set up absurd situations, detached from reality, and then try to reason from them.

One of the most puzzling aspects of Friday's drop was the speed with which the damage to UAL spilled over to other stocks. Market professionals say that major arbitragers and others such as hedge funds, which were heavily invested in UAL and highly leveraged, couldn't get any cash out of their UAL positions because trading halted. Once UAL were to reopen, such speculators faced the likelihood of margin calls - demands from lenders to put up more cash for stock positions bought with borrowed funds. So such traders quickly tried to raise cash by selling other so-called deal stocks, like AMR (American Airlines) and USAir.

The rest are split roughly between optimists who expect Hong Kong to hum along as before and pessimists who foresee irreparable chaos.

Peasants in Inner Mongolia have partly dismantled a 20-mile section of China's famed Great Wall, the official People's Daily said. The paper said the bricks were used to build homes and furnaces and, as a result, the wall “is in terrible shape.”

Salomon, moreover, gets its data on art appreciation from Sotheby's, whose prices go up with clients like Mr. Paul in its thrall.

The matter may never even be tried in court.

AG is hardly alone in its anxiety. A rambunctious shake-up is quickly reshaping Europe's once-stately insurance business. Worried by European Community directives that will remove many of the barriers to cross-border insurance services, starting in mid-1990, insurers are rushing to find partners and preparing for price wars. In West Germany and the Netherlands, insurers are flirting with banks. In France, Suez and Axa-Midi Assurances S.A. both have been on the prowl for giant acquisitions; Suez last month acquired control of Groupe Victoire, the sixth-largest European insurance company, after a takeover battle with Cie. Industrielle.

But internal church documents clearly show that at its publicity-seeking heights, as when it organized a spectacular Yankee Stadium bicentennial rally in 1976, there actually were only about 2,000 full-time Unification Church members in the U.S. Mr. Moon's support for a Watergate-beleaguered Richard Nixon, the Koreagate scandal, and his prison sentence for income-tax evasion did not help the church's recruitment efforts. Defections, burnouts, and abduction “deprogrammings” kept member turnover high. That the membership number has even kept close to its 1976 size is the result of the “graying” of the church. Many of the enthusiastic young “Moonies” of the Nixon era who remained faithful to Father Moon are now parents, producing new members by procreation rather than conversion.

For Ms. Cunningham the architectural discombobulation matched the discrepancy she felt living in the AnaMor Towers as a little girl: “... outwardly ordinary, inwardly ornate, owing all inspiration to heathen cultures.” Sharp-witted and funny but never mean, she's a memorialist a bit like Truman Capote, if he'd been Jewish and female and less bitchy.

Large and lavish, “Traviata” is another addition to the Met's growing stock of cast-proof productions mostly by Mr. Zeffirelli. They have a life of their own and can be counted on to look good and perform whenever a cast isn't up to either. If a strike ever hits the Met, the company can still sell tickets to his “Boheme” and “Turandot” and boom out recordings (of another era). Last week's discerning audience gave a bigger hand to a greenhouse than to the tenor Neil Shicoff, who sang an aria inside it. Inexplicably costumed as a rabbinical student, tottering around on lifts, Mr. Shicoff hardly seemed the fellow to catch a fancy cocotte's eye. I wish he could wear lifts in his voice. Not nearly in his best form, the tenor made dullish sounds along with his usual clumsy hand gestures. Maybe Mr. Z. was too busy taming his set to work with his naturally ungainly Alfredo. Or is it that Mr. Z. is getting a little tired of “Traviata”? This is the same production already seen in Paris and Florence, and its scenic ideas echo the movie he made with Placido Domingo and Teresa Stratas. Decades earlier, Maria Callas sang the Dallas staging that introduced the flashback idea. In an invention that drives Verdi purists bananas, Violetta lies dying in bed during the prelude, rising deliriously when then she remembers the great parties she used to throw. The entire opera is her dream.

Today, the pixie-like clarinetist has mostly dropped the missionary work (though a touch of the old Tashi still survives) and now goes on the road with piano, bass, a slide show, and a repertoire that ranges from light classical to light jazz to light pop, with a few notable exceptions. Just the thing for the Vivaldi-at-brunch set, the yuppie audience that has embraced New Age as its very own easy listening. But you can't dismiss Mr. Stoltzman's music or his motives as merely commercial and lightweight. He believes in what he plays, and he plays superbly. His recent appearance at the Metropolitan Museum, dubbed “A Musical Odyssey,” was a case in point. It felt more like a party, or a highly polished jam session with a few friends, than a classical concert.

It's an optimistic move in a industry already facing world-wide overcapacity.

At that point domestic sales will slow down,” says Kim Yoon Kwon, director of marketing for Daewoo Motor.

The problem, however, is that GM's moves are coming at a time when UAW leaders are trying to silence dissidents who charge the union is too passive in the face of GM layoffs. Against that backdrop, UAW Vice President Stephen P. Yokich, who recently became head of the union's GM department, issued a statement Friday blasting GM's “flagrant insensitivity” toward union members. The auto maker's decision to let word of the latest shutdowns and product reassignments trickle out in separate communiques to the affected plants showed “disarray” and an “inability or unwillingness to provide consistent information,” Mr. Yokich said.

“The stock market is sick because profits are crumbling,” says Michael K. Evans, president of Evans Economics Inc., Washington. The economy, he noted, moves the market, not vice versa. On the other hand, Mr. Evans expects the hurricane and the earthquake “to take a hunk out of fourth-quarter GNP.” His estimate of 3.3% for third-quarter GNP is higher than the consensus largely because he believes current inventories aren't as low as official figures indicate. Demand, he believes, is being met from overhang rather than new production.

The result last spring was the arrest by West German authorities of five young West Germans, accused of stealing information from computers in the U.S. and Europe and selling it to the Soviet KGB. One of them, 25-year-old Markus Hess of Hannover, allegedly used the international telecommunications network to break into more than 30 high-security computers in the U.S., searching for secrets. He probably didn't penetrate any top-secret files, but the KGB in East Berlin was willing to pay two of his associates, Peter Carl and Dirk Brezinski, $15,000 for some of the material Hess collected. They promised yet more for really good stuff.

SUGAR: Futures prices rose on a report that Cuba may seek to postpone some sugar shipments. The March contract advanced 0.14 cent a pound to 14.11 cents. According to an analyst, Cuba can't meet all its shipment commitments and has asked Japan to accept a delay of shipments scheduled for later this year, into early next year. “Japan is perceived as a wealthy nation that can turn elsewhere in the world market and buy the sugar,” the analyst said. It was the possibility of this demand that helped firm prices, the analyst said. Another analyst noted that Cuba has been deferring shipments in recent years. “To the professionals in the trade it didn't cause much surprise. The March futures contract traded as high as 14.24 cents, but couldn't sustain the advance,” he said.

Others undoubtedly will follow, but most analysts believe Compaq has at least a six-month lead on the competition. Toshiba's line of portables, for example, features the T-1000, which is in the same weight class but is much slower and has less memory, and the T-1600, which also uses a 286 microprocessor, but which weighs almost twice as much and is three times the size. A third model, marketed in Japan, may hit the U.S. by the end of the first quarter of 1990, but by then, analysts say, Compaq will have established itself as one of three major players.

Economists said the report raised speculation that the economic slowdown could turn into a recession, which would pave the way for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. But later in the day, a report by the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago cast doubt on the recession scenario. The association said its October index of economic activity rose to 51.6% after having been below 50% for three consecutive months. A reading below 50% indicates that the manufacturing industry is slowing while a reading above 50% suggests that the industry is expanding. Bond prices fell after the Chicago report was released.

In investing on the basis of future transactions, a role often performed by merchant banks, trading companies can cut through the logjam that small-company owners often face with their local commercial banks. “It's the classic problem of the small businessman,” says Malcolm Davies, managing director of Trading Alliance Corp. of New York. “People are queuing at the door to take his product but he doesn't have the working capital to make the thing and commercial banks are very unsympathetic. They want assets, they want a balance sheet, which has no relation to the business a company can generate.”

As aftershocks shook the San Francisco Bay area, rescuers searched through rubble for survivors of Tuesday's temblor, and residents picked their way through glass-strewn streets.

At least 270 people were reported killed and 1,400 injured in the rush-hour tremor that caused billions of dollars of damage along 100 miles of the San Andreas fault. Bush declared the region a major disaster area and the military was mobilized to prevent looting.

Then, to buttress his credibility with the left, he enticed some smaller leftist parties to stand for election under the PASOK banner. Next, he continued to court the communists - many of whom feel betrayed by the left-right coalition's birth - by bringing into PASOK a well-respected Communist Party candidate. For balance, and in hopes of gaining some disaffected centrist votes, he managed to attract a former New Democracy Party representative and known political enemy of Mr. Mitsotakis. Thus PASOK heads for the polls not only with diminished scandal-stench, but also with “seals of approval” from representatives of its harshest accusers.

Choice of the volunteer military in the 1970s seemed to doom national service as much as the draft. But the virus was kept alive in sociology departments until a couple of years ago, when it again was let loose. This time it attempted to invade two connected problems, the rising cost of higher education and the rising expense to the federal government of educational grants and loans. Why not keep and even expand the loans and grants, the advocates reasoned, but require some form of service from each recipient? Military service, moreover, could be a national-service option.

Which cars do Americans favor most these days? It's hard to generalize, but age seems to be the best predictor.

British, West German, Scandinavian and other overseas insurers are bracing for big claims from the San Francisco earthquake disaster.

Jack Byrne, chairman of Fireman's Fund, said this disaster will test the catastrophe reinsurance market, causing these rates to soar.

Ms. Bogart's cast is part and parcel of the problem. Ed Shea and Barbara Orson never find a real reason for their love affair as the foolish, idealistic young Vass and the tirelessly humanitarian doctor Maria Lvovna. Cynthia Strickland as the long-suffering Varvara is a tiresome whiner, not the inspirational counterrevolutionary Gorky intended. Better to look in the corners for performances that inspire or amuse. Janice Duclos, in addition to possessing one of the evening's more impressive vocal instruments, brings an unsuspected comedic touch to her role of Olga, everybody's favorite mom. Marni Rice plays the maid with so much edge as to steal her two scenes. But it is the Trinity Rep newcomer, Jonathan Fried (Zamislov, the paralegal) who is the actor to watch, whether he is hamming it up while conducting the chamber musicians or seducing his neighbor's wife (Becca Lish) by licking her bosom.

We should also add Mr. Lawson's own explanation, as we understand it. Unlike the U.S., Britain never achieved even a momentary reduction in real wages.

A similar technique is almost impossible to apply to other crops, such as cotton, soybeans and rice. The male part, the anthers of the plant, and the female, the pistils, of the same plant are within a fraction of an inch or even attached to each other. The anthers in these plants are difficult to clip off. In China, a great number of workers are engaged in pulling out the male organs of rice plants using tweezers, and one-third of rice produced in that country is grown from hybrid seeds. At Plant Genetic Systems, researchers have isolated a pollen-inhibiting gene that can be inserted in a plant to confer male sterility. Jan Leemans, research director, said this gene was successfully introduced in oil-producing rapeseed plants, a major crop in Europe and Canada, using as a carrier a “promoter gene” developed by Robert Goldberg at the University of California in Los Angeles.

Now, sterilized intervention may have some effect. When traders see the Fed is in the exchange market it may make them tread a little carefully, for fear of what the central bank may do. But it's generally accepted that sterilized intervention has little or no lasting impact on currency values. After August the Fed may have stopped sterilizing, but it's hard to see much impact on the dollar. The dollar is still highly volatile. The Fed has let interest rates slip slightly, but whether the main reason was dollar intervention, the gloomy reports on manufacturing employment, or the Friday 13 market drop, only Mr. Greenspan and his associates know.

The marriage of news and theater, if not exactly inevitable, has been consummated nonetheless. News programs, particularly if they score well in the ratings, appeal to the networks' cost-conscious corporate parents because they are so much less expensive to produce than an entertainment show is - somewhere between $400,000 and $500,000 for a one-hour program. Entertainment shows tend to cost twice that. Re-enactments have been used successfully for several seasons on such syndicated “tabloid TV” shows as “A Current Affair,” which is produced by the Fox Broadcasting Co. unit of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. That show, whose host is Ms. Chung's husband, Maury Povich, has a particular penchant for grisly murders and stories having to do with sex - the Robert Chambers murder case, the Rob Lowe tapes, what have you.

What tongue to speak is an emotional mine field in the Philippines. It is entrenched in the country's colonial bonds to the U.S., in Philippine class structure, in the regional loyalties of its people and in its island geography. As they did when the Philippines was a colony of the U.S., teachers for the most part teach in English, even though it is a foreign language for most Philippine children. As a result, they often speak one language at home, another at school. Mrs. Brown calls the modern-day cultural ambivalence to Filipino a “language schizophrenia.”

The owner was Israel Ortiz, a 29-year-old entrepreneur and father of two. In his first year of operating the store he bought for $220,000, Mr. Ortiz was robbed at least twice at gunpoint. The first time he was shot in the hand as he chased the robbers outside. The second time he identified two robbers, who were arrested and charged. Two weeks later - perhaps in retaliation - Mr. Ortiz was shot three times in the back, during what police classified as a third robbery attempt.

At Quantum Chemical Corp., New York, the trouble is lower prices for polyethylene, higher debt costs and the idling of an important plant due to an explosion. Some analysts hedge their estimates for Quantum, because it isn't known when the company will book certain one-time charges. But the estimates range from break-even to 35 cents a share. In the 1988 third quarter, Quantum earned $99.8 million, or $3.92 a share, on sales of $724.4 million.

Commodore said that its announcement is based on preliminary information and that the situation could look different by the time final results are announced early next month. In fact, Commodore's fiscal fourth-quarter loss was $2 million narrower than Commodore had expected a few weeks after the quarter closed. Still, even results approaching break-even would mark a sharp weakening compared with fiscal 1989 first-quarter earnings of $9.6 million, or 30 cents a share, on sales of $200.2 million.

PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices showed modest changes in light trading volume. December delivery gold eased 40 cents an ounce to $380.80. December silver was off 3.7 cents an ounce at $5.2830. January platinum rose 90 cents an ounce at $500.20. The market turned quiet after rising sharply late last week, according to one analyst. Last week's uncertainty in the stock market and a weaker dollar triggered a flight to safety, he said, but yesterday the market lacked such stimuli. There was some profit-taking because prices for all the precious metals had risen to levels at which there was resistance to further advance, he said. The dollar was also slightly firmer and prompted some selling, as well, according to the analyst.

Nigel Lawson was a victim of the immense confusion in thought that has been characteristic of Western financial circles during the 1980s. The most important governments have ignored the role of low tax rates in attracting real capital investment, instead emphasizing financial flows in response to high interest rates. This has led them in a fruitless and destructive policy circle. First comes monetary expansion to drive down the currency's value that was pushed up by tax-rate reduction. Then, when the currency falls, interest rates are raised to attract financial flows in order to stabilize the exchange rate. This policy is totally mindless, and Sir Alan is correct to point out its deficiencies.

Another solution cities might consider is giving special priority to police patrols of small-business areas. For cities losing business to suburban shopping centers, it may be a wise business investment to help keep those jobs and sales taxes within city limits. Increased patrolling of business zones makes sense because urban crime is heavily concentrated in such “hot spots” of pedestrian density. With National Institute of Justice support, the Minneapolis police and the Crime Control Institute are currently testing the effects of such a strategy, comparing its deterrence value with traditional random patrols.

Copper fell and showed little rebound through the day as one of the major supply problems that had been supporting prices appeared to be solved. Crude oil declined early, but as the stock market retained early gains, it, too, became stronger, ending with a small net loss.

What is one to think of all this? Doctrine and special interests govern some responses. People eager to have youth “pay their dues to society” favor service proposals - preferably mandatory ones. So do those who seek a “re-energized concept of citizenship,” a concept imposing stern obligations as well as conferring rights. Then there are instinctive opponents. To libertarians, mandatory service is an abomination and voluntary systems are illegitimate uses of tax money. Devotees of the market question the value of the work national service would perform: If the market won't pay for it, they argue, it can't be worth its cost. Elements of the left are also reflexively opposed; they see service as a cover for the draft, or fear the regimentation of youth, or want to see rights enlarged, not obligations.

Courts and legislatures make decisions in very different ways and are each susceptible to very different kinds of errors. After-the-fact judicial examination of an actor's conduct has always been the common law's method. When only civil liability is involved, this method has the undeniable strengths of factual specificity and avoidance of overgeneralization. Still, case-by-case retrospective decision making of this sort is vulnerable to the tunnel vision caused by a fixation on ad hoc (and usually sleazy) examples. When a court decides that a particular actor's conduct was culpable and so extends the definition of insider trading to reach this conduct, it does not see the potentially enormous number of other cases that will be covered by the expanded rule.

But all that was a long time ago and politicians have a way of forgetting such things. The 1970s inflation yielded great benefits to some producer interests, including Arab sheiks, at the expense of the American middle class. It was a classic example of how inflation transfers income to the wealthy from the middle class. That explains why there are always powerful political interests pushing for a soft currency. In some countries, Argentina for example, those interests have overwhelmed the government and what remains of a middle class.

Scientists need to understand that while they tend to believe their work is primarly about establishing new knowledge or doing good, today it is also about power. In a media-linked world, scientists may earn wide praise and even Nobels for their work, but they also attract the attention of people who wish to gain control over the content, funding and goals of that work. When a David Baltimore - or the next target - decides it is better to stand up to these forces, his fellow scientists would do well to recognize what is fundamentally at stake, and offer their public support.

Suppression of the book, Judge Oakes observed, would operate as a prior restraint and thus involve the First Amendment.

Getting a level playing field. This argument is perhaps the most interesting one for abolishing program trading - not because of its merits, but because of the firms championing the cause. The loudest of these reformers are money managers who cater to smaller investors. They continually advise their clients on which individual stocks to buy or sell, while their clients continue to hope for superior performance. Even with mutual funds, the little investor continues to tolerate high fees, high commissions and poor performance, while index-fund managers slowly amass a better record with lower fees, lower commissions and less risk. Yet our efforts are somehow less noble than those of an investment expert studiously devouring press clippings on each company he follows.

W. Mark Goode, president of Micronyx Inc., a Richardson, Texas, firm that makes computer-security products, provided a new definition for Mikhail Gorbachev's campaign for greater openness, known commonly as glasnost. Under Mr. Gorbachev, Mr. Goode said, the Soviets are openly stealing Western corporate communications. He cited the case of a Swiss oil trader who recently put out bids via telex for an oil tanker to pick up a cargo of crude in the Middle East. Among the responses the Swiss trader got was one from the Soviet national shipping company, which hadn't been invited to submit a bid. The Soviets' eavesdropping paid off, however, because they got the contract.

According to veteran watchers of Unificationist affairs, such as Dr. J.

That two successful producers who aren't all that well known outside Hollywood could occasion such a clash of corporate titans suggests how desperate the quest for proven talent is in the movie business. And they are a very odd team in any case. Mr. Guber was raised in Boston and educated in New York. He is a lawyer with a string of academic degrees. Mr. Peters is a high-school dropout who came to fame as Barbra Streisand's hairdresser. Yet, they are far and away the most prolific producers in Hollywood.

An aggressive Ford bid for Jaguar would put pressure on GM to make a better offer as the British company's “white knight.” Such a countermove could end Jaguar's hopes for remaining independent and British-owned.

Convertible mortgages have become an increasingly popular way to finance prestigious buildings of late. In a convertible mortgage, the investor lends the building owner a certain amount in return for the option to convert its interest into equity, usually less than 50%, at the end of the loan term. During the term, the lender can either receive a percentage of cash flow, a percentage of the building's appreciation or a fixed return. The main advantage of a convertible mortgage is that it is not a sale and therefore does not trigger costly transfer taxes and reappraisal.

One of the few hints the excess heat might be produced by fusion came from brief remarks by chemist John Bockris of Texas A&M University. Mr. Bockris previously reported getting bursts of excess heat and of detecting increasing amounts of tritium forming in the heavy water. He said that within the past few days, he's gotten evidence that there is a “weak correlation” between the time the heat bursts occur and the production of tritium. There isn't any way to continuously measure the amount of tritium in the heavy water, so it's been difficult to tell whether the tritium formation is related to the heat bursts or some other phenomenon.

But Lloyd's is hampered in its efforts to overhaul operations by its reluctance to embrace modern technology. Mr. Wetherell, the underwriter, reckons half of his business could be transacted by computer, cutting costs at least 10%. Though Lloyd's has talked for years about computerizing underwriting transactions, the effort hasn't gotten very far. Competition among underwriters and brokers makes them loath to centralize price and policy information. Both groups cling to traditional face-to-face dealings, even for routine policies.

Finally, the case of Dr. Morgan gave Congress an opportunity to act with unaccustomed decisiveness and to engage in one of its favorite pastimes - bashing the District of Columbia government.

Ethan Bronner's “Battle for Justice: How the Bork Nomination Shook America” (Norton, 399 pages, $22.50) is a spirited narrative of the nastiest of these hearings, done with journalistic verve, but with a flawed legal philosophy. While the book amply justifies its subtitle, the title itself is dubious. What shook America was not a battle for justice but for naked power, in which an army of judicial activists rolled over a judge they had demonized.

The experiment, applicable to many genetic disorders, involved beta-thalassemia, a severe blood anemia resulting from a missing hemoglobin gene. It's an inherited human disorder that's been duplicated in mice. In the experiment, mice with the defective gene were mated. Three days later, before the new embryo had become implanted in the uterus, it was washed out of the mother mouse. The embryo had progressed only to a clump of eight identical cells. One cell was teased out, and its DNA extracted.

Rosie died young and Lily has remembered her as a romantic figure, who didn't interfere much with her child's education on the streets. The games Bronx children played (holding kids down and stripping them, for example) seem tame by today's crack standards, but Ms. Cunningham makes it all sound like a great adventure. “Without official knowledge of sex or death, we flirted with both,” she writes. She analyzed families by their sleeping arrangements. Her friend Susan, whose parents kept reminding her she was unwanted, slept on a narrow bed wedged into her parents' bedroom, as though she were a temporary visitor. Her friend Diana's father was a professional thief; they didn't seem to have any bedrooms at all.

I realize you were just looking for something snotty to say about California and its environmental movement, but picking Frank Lloyd Wright to say it for you was a bad call. Wright's organic architecture demonstrated a keen sensitivity to the environment decades before it became fashionable among “la-la activists.” Indeed, Wright said all his life that the greatest lessons he learned were derived from the study of nature.

If that money were being taxed, it could bring the government a badly needed several trillion yen. In 1984, an attempt was made to crack down on the industry with tougher restrictions. Then, in 1988, a proposal to keep better track of income by selling prepaid cards for pachinko was fielded in parliament. The proposal split the industry in two, along the lines of national origin: North Koreans oppose the plan while South Koreans, Japanese and Taiwanese accept it or are neutral.

The closeness of Soviet perestroika to the fascist social blueprint of Mussolini was evident when Mr. Gorbachev presented his economic vision to the Soviet Congress. In doing so, he neither rejected a socialist planned economy nor embraced the free market. Instead, he proposed a “law-governed economy,” in which there would be a “clear-cut division between state direction of the economy and economic management.” The latter would be undertaken by “enterprises, joint stock companies and cooperatives.” These would not function independently, but would act together to form “combines, unions and associations” to tackle problems and coordinate their activities.

Adjusters must count the number of bathrooms, balconies, fireplaces, chimneys, microwaves and dishwashers. But they must also assign a price to each of these items as well as to floors, wallcoverings, roofing and siding, to come up with a total value for a house. To do that, they must think in terms of sheetrock by the square foot, carpeting by the square yard, wallpaper by the roll, molding by the linear foot. Using a calculator and a unit-price guide for such jobs as painting, plumbing and roofing in each major region of the country, adjusters can figure out the value of a home in today's market and what it would cost to rebuild it.

Mr. Engelken, a rabid baseball fan, pores over the sports pages to chart the exploits of “my favorite and not-so-favorite teams and players.” He often groans, he says, at the “clutter” of sports stories about drugs, alcohol, gambling and some player's lament “about the miserly millions he is offered to play the game.” His morning paper, the Washington Post, even carries a sports column called “Jurisprudence” that recounts the latest arrests and convictions of players and team managers. Like many sports buffs, Mr. Engelken has turned cynic.

The three most important things to understand about Mr. Allen is that he is a black conservative intellectual - a triple threat to the liberal establishment. Mr. Allen, who teaches government at prestigious Harvey Mudd College in California and will remain a member of the commission, has spent years arguing that civil rights are individuals' rights. He last made waves when he dared to defend an Indian girl who had been adopted by non-Indian parents off her reservation. Mr. Allen quickly ran up against the liberal establishment again, which somehow elevated the vague concept of “Indian rights” above the rights of individual Indians.

Thousands of supporters, many brandishing flags of the outlawed African National Congress, gave the anti-apartheid activists a tumultuous reception upon their return to black townships across the country. Most of those freed had spent at least 25 years in prison. The 77-year-old Sisulu, sentenced to life in 1964 along with black nationalist Nelson Mandela for plotting to overthrow the government, said equality for blacks in South Africa was in reach. The releases, announced last week by President de Klerk, were viewed as Pretoria's tacit legalization of the ANC.

Most institutional investors have abandoned the portfolio insurance hedging technique, which is widely thought to have worsened the 1987 crash. Not really insurance, this tactic was designed to soften the blow of declining stock prices and generate an offsetting profit by selling waves of S&P futures contracts. In its severest test, the $60 billion of portfolio insurance in effect in the 1987 crash didn't work, as stock buyers disappeared and stock and futures prices became disconnected.

Mr. Van de Kamp and his allies may be hoping that the environment is such a mom and apple-pie issue among certain segments of California's population now that almost any collection of anti-scientific, anti-pocketbook nonsense can pass under its rubric. Of course the state's liberals are not yet a nation unto themselves. George Bush, for example, may decide that he doesn't want to be the President who lost control of interstate commerce to an attorney general from California. And some other segments of California's political and media culture may yet start to point out that the initiative would impose significant costs on the state's less affluent citizens in the form of higher food prices and lost jobs.

Cathay also is moving some of its labor-intensive data-processing operations outside Hong Kong. Fierce bidding for young employees in Hong Kong is pushing up Cathay's labor costs by 20% a year for low-level staff, while experienced, skilled employees are leaving the colony as part of the brain drain. Some jobs already have been moved to Australia, and there are plans to place others in Canada. David Bell, a spokesman for the airline, says the move is partly aimed at retaining existing staff who are leaving to secure foreign passports ahead of 1997.

Deep discounts in subscriptions and offers of free clock radios and watches have become accepted forms of attracting new subscribers in the hyper-competitive world of magazine news-weeklies.

Congress is in no position to naysay Mr. Bush now that we're into Gramm-Rudman's sequestration. Just this week, the House-Senate conference met - 231 conferees, divided into 26 different subconferences. Senator Daniel Inouye agreed to close some bases in Hawaii in exchange for such goodies as $11 million for a parking lot at Walter Reed Hospital. Conference negotiator Rep. Bill Hefner pulled down $40 million in military bases for North Carolina and graciously allowed Senator James Sasser $70 million for bases in Tennessee. President Bush should take the Constitution in one hand and a budget ax in the other and get to work. He should chop out both unconstitutional provisions and budget pork. Congress may have lost any sense of discipline, but that doesn't mean the country must learn to live forever with this mess. President Bush has the power to change how Washington works, if only he will use it.

Western Union indeed wanted to get into the telephone business. It acquired Thomas Edison's microphone patent and then immediately sued the Bell Co. claiming that the microphone invented by my grandfather, Emile Berliner, which had been sold to Bell for a princely $50,000, infringed upon Western Union's Edison patent. When Bell established that the Berliner patent caveat was registered 10 days before Edison's application, Western Union dropped the lawsuit and agreed never to enter the telephone business - the basis for the company's current plight.

COCOA: Futures rallied modestly. The December contract rose $33 a metric ton to $1,027, near its high for the day. Gill & Duffus Ltd., a British cocoa-trading house, estimated that the 1989-90 world cocoa surplus would be 231,000 tons, down from 314,000 tons for the previous year. Market technicians were encouraged by the price patterns, which in the past have preceded sharp rallies. Recent prices for cocoa have been near levels last seen in the mid-1970s. At such prices, according to Mr. Savaiko, bargain hunting and short-covering - buying back of contracts previously sold - by speculators isn't uncommon. But Mr. Savaiko expects stepped-up producer selling at around the $1,040 to $1,050 level. He also noted that a strong sterling market yesterday might have helped cocoa in New York as arbitragers took advantage of the currency move. Sandra Kaul, research analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton, said the market pushed higher mainly in anticipation of a late harvest in the Ivory Coast, a major cocoa producer.

At Quantum, which is based in New York, the trouble is magnified by the company's heavy dependence on plastics. Once known as National Distillers & Chemical Corp., the company exited the wine and spirits business and plowed more of its resources into plastics after Mr. Stookey took the chief executive's job in 1986. Mr. Stookey, 59 years old, declined to be interviewed for this article, but he has consistently argued that over the long haul - across both the peaks and the troughs of the plastics market - Quantum will prosper through its new direction.

From the perspective of East Germany's old guard, reforms that smack of capitalism and Western-style democracy could eliminate their country's reason for being. Unlike the other nations of the bloc, East Germany is a creature of the Cold War. Erasing the differences still dividing Europe, and the vast international reordering that implies, won't endanger the statehood of a Poland or a Hungary. But it could ultimately lead to German reunification and the disappearance of East Germany from the map. Which is what the Old Guard fears. “I'm sure they'll formulate a reform that will be a recipe for the GDR's future as a separately identifiable state,” says Michael Simmons, a British journalist whose book on East Germany, entitled “The Unloved Country,” was published this month.

The result? The Commerce Department found that U.S. exports in 1988, net of imports, were understated by $20.9 billion a year and understated at the annualized rate of $25.4 billion in the first quarter of 1989. More than half of the “newly found” net exports were from just a few service-sector categories.

We can applaud Mr. Pryor's moment of epiphany, even as we understand that he and his confreres need restraint lest they kill again. A good place to start the rehabilitation is a “legislative line-item veto” bill now being offered by Indiana Senator Dan Coats. The Coats bill, which already has 32 Senate co-sponsors, isn't a pure line-item veto because it would apply only to spending bills. Instead it's a form of “enhanced rescission,” giving a President a chance to rescind, or strike, specific spending items that just go too far.

Indeed, analysts say that payouts have sometimes risen most sharply when prices were already on their way down from cyclical peaks. In 1976, for example, dividends on the stocks in Standard & Poor's 500-stock index soared 10%, following much slower growth the year before. The S&P index started sliding in price in September 1976, and fell 12% in 1977 - despite a 15% expansion in dividends that year.

This is New York City. When the dust and dirt settle in an extra-nasty mayoral race, the man most likely to gain custody of all this is a career politician named David Dinkins.

As the campaign hits the home stretch, however, voters still have very little idea what they can expect from him. After 25 years in city politics, David Dinkins remains an enigma.

Baron Elie de Rothschild, the family's elder spokesman, explains that by the end of the 19th century, Berlin had replaced Frankfurt as Germany's financial center.

The result is that the unthinkable and illogical are happening. Six months ago, government approval for an ANC rally was inconceivable. Equally inconceivable is that the ANC, given the chance to hold a rally, would extend a hand, albeit warily, to the government.

Soon after that report, two other research teams uncovered evidence that the same damaged p53 gene is present in tissue from lung and breast cancers. Colon, lung and breast cancers are the most common and lethal forms of the disease, collectively killing almost 200,000 Americans a year. Right now about a dozen laboratories, in the U.S., Canada and Britain, are racing to unmask other suspected tumor-suppressing genes. They have about seven candidates. Researchers say the inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes, alone or in combination, appears crucial to the development of such scourges as cancer of the brain, the skin, kidney, prostate, and cervix. There is evidence that if people inherit defective versions of these genes, they are especially prone to cancer, perhaps explaining, finally, why some cancers seem to haunt certain families.

Digital's new line has been a long time coming.

By starving the peasant, the Communists have starved Poland. Villages like Zalubice exist in a desert of poor schools and few doctors. Farm income is 15% below the average.

Steppenwolf needs the extra seats even more than the fly space. It's currently forced to turn away many potential subscribers beyond the 13,000 who can be accommodated in its present digs. For all the attention that Chicago theater has received during the past decade, not one new building has been devoted to it. Mr. Sagan, a former publisher and real estate developer, has put together an $8 million financial package that includes approximately $4 million of tax exempt bonds issued by the State of Illinois (the first time that a state has used its educational facilities authority to support construction of a theater), and approximately $1 million in grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, the MacArthur Foundation, and a few other deep pockets. The rest, he is confident, can be raised. His board members alone have pledged $800,000 and he is just beginning to massage local foundations and corporations.

PRECIOUS METALS: Platinum and palladium struggled to maintain their prices all day despite news stories over the weekend that recent cold fusion experiments, which use both metals, showed signs of producing extra heat. January platinum closed down $2.80 an ounce at $486.30, nearly $4 above its low for the day. December palladium was off $1.55 an ounce at $137.20. Platinum is believed to have good support around $480 and palladium at around $130. Some traders were thought to be waiting for the auto sales report, which will be released today. Such sales are watched closely by platinum and palladium traders because both metals are used in automobile catalytic converters. Mr. Savaiko theorized that the news on cold fusion didn't affect the market yesterday because many traders have already been badly burnt by such stories. He said the traders are demanding a higher level of proof before they will buy palladium again. Also weighing on both metals' prices is the role of the chief supplier, the Soviet Union. Many analysts believe that the Soviets' thirst for dollars this year to buy grain and other Western commodities and goods will bring them to the market whenever prices rally very much.

Because the Bush administration isn't taking the initiative on health issues, business executives are dealing with congressional Democrats who champion health-care revision. “Business across the country is spending more time addressing this issue,” says Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.). “It's a bottom-line issue.” Business complained earlier this year when Sen. Kennedy introduced a bill that would require employers to provide a minimum level of health insurance to workers but doesn't contain cost-control measures. Partly in response, a bipartisan group of senators from the finance and labor committees is drafting a plan to attract broader support. It will feature a cost-containment provision designed to keep expanded benefits from fueling higher care prices.

2. Formally or informally, train all your managers and supervisors in the company's due-process approach. See that they know company personnel policy backwards and forwards, for it is the “law” governing company courts and adjudicators. Coach them in handling complaints so that they can resolve problems immediately. In case managers and personnel specialists are unsuccessful and subordinates take their complaints to a company court or adjudicator, teach managers to accept reversals as a fact of business life, for in a good due-process system they are bound to happen. In the 15 companies I studied, reversal rates range on the average from 20% to 40%.

In 1900, for instance, less than 8% of assets went into bank deposits. That rose to nearly 18% during the Depression, and hasn't changed much since. Pension reserves, on the other hand, made up a relatively small part of household assets until the last decade, when they skyrocketed. And there has been a drastic decline in the importance of unincorporated business assets - thanks to industry consolidation and a decline in family farms.

On this evening, the dancers seem reluctant, as a sour eight-piece band plods through a series of Chinese pop songs. But things come to life when a slender woman in a slinky black dress takes the microphone. The band starts in, and she begins to sing “Happy birthday to you,” even though it isn't anyone's birthday. Immediately, hundreds of couples leap to their feet and rush onto the floor, dancing their well-rehearsed three-step, cheek-to-cheek. Happy Birthday, apparently a big hit in Panzhihua, lasts for 10 glorious minutes.

THE CASE OF THE FAKE DALIS: In federal court in Manhattan, three defendants pleaded guilty to charges of fraud in connection with the sale of fake Salvador Dali lithographs. James Burke and Larry Evans, formerly owners of the now-defunct Barclay Gallery, and Prudence Clark, a Barclay sales representative, were charged with conducting high-pressure telephone sales in which they misrepresented cheap copies of Dali artwork as signed, limited-edition lithographs. The posters were sold for $1,300 to $6,000, although the government says they had a value of only $53 to $200 apiece. Henry Pitman, the assistant U.S. attorney handling the case, said about 1,000 customers were defrauded and that Barclay's total proceeds from the sales were $3.4 million. Attorneys for Messrs. Burke and Evans and Ms. Clarke said that although their clients admitted to making some misrepresentations in the sales, they had believed that the works were authorized by Mr. Dali, who died in January. The posters were printed on paper pre-signed by Mr. Dali, the attorneys said.

The Bush administration earlier this year said it would extend steel quotas, known as voluntary restraint agreements, until March 31, 1992. It also said it would use that two-and-a-half year period to work toward an international consensus on freeing up the international steel trade, which has been notoriously managed, subsidized and protected by governments. The U.S. termed its plan, a “trade liberalization program,” despite the fact that it is merely an extension.

In the September issue of Scientific American, Thomas E. Graedel, distinguished member of the technical staff at AT&T Bell Laboratories, and Paul J.

He is a mechanical engineer, not an atmospheric chemist.

The 1981 novel “Wedding Song” also is experimental, and another badly aimed bullet. The story of a playwright's stage debut unfolds in first-person monologues, in the manner of Faulkner's “The Sound and the Fury.” But the device obscures more than it illuminates. Buried in the work is a meditation on the morality of art, and on the struggle for integrity in an unfair world. But again, the themes get tangled in Mr. Mahfouz's elliptical storytelling. The indirectness of his later work reflects both an appetite for new genres and the hazards of art in the Arab world. Mr. Mahfouz has been pilloried and censored for questioning Islam and advocating peace with Israel. Veiling his message has helped him endure. Art, says the playwright in “Wedding Song,” is “the surrogate for the action that an idealist like me is unable to take.”

But maintaining U.S. influence will be difficult in the face of Japanese dominance in the region. Japan not only outstrips the U.S. in investment flows but also outranks it in trade with most Southeast Asian countries (although the U.S. remains the leading trade partner for all of Asia). Moreover, the Japanese government, now the world's largest aid donor, is pumping far more assistance into the region than the U.S. is. While U.S. officials voice optimism about Japan's enlarged role in Asia, they also convey an undertone of caution. “There's an understanding on the part of the U.S. that Japan has to expand its functions” in Asia, says J. Michael Farren, undersecretary of commerce for trade. “If they approach it with a benevolent, altruistic attitude, there will be a net gain for everyone.”

Digital's VAX 9000 mainframes, which it claimed were among the fastest available, were priced from $1.2 million to $3.9 million, sharply lower than IBM models of comparable power. The first models will ship in the spring, with the largest following in the fall. Analysts were disappointed that Digital's new line apparently won't contribute much to earnings before the next fiscal year, which begins in July. Jay Stevens of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. said he may cut his earnings estimate for the current fiscal year because he had expected at least some mainframe profit this year. But he added that he expected to raise his estimate for fiscal 1991 at the same time.

Consumers want selection to be easy and efficient, but that's not what most merchandisers want. Retailers generally go to lengths to keep shoppers in their stores as long as possible. Many stores, for example, require customers to walk through a maze of boutiques designed to show off their wares just to find, say, a simple white blouse. But rather than tempt people to buy more, consumer researchers say, this tactic just irritates many shoppers. Over half the respondents in the Journal survey said they rarely buy on impulse anyway.

Trading in Walt Disney Co. particularly caught traders' eyes. According to Big Board officials, Disney had one of the biggest sell-order imbalances on Friday; it was one of the seven stocks that couldn't finish trading that day. The stock opened late at 114 1\/2, down 8 1\/2. But then it shot upward 7 1\/2 as Goldman, Sachs & Co. stepped in and bought, traders said.

Adults with AIDS have had access to AZT since FDA approved the drug's usage for adults in March 1987. But despite more than two years of research showing AZT can relieve dementia and other symptoms in children, the drug still lacks federal approval for use in the youngest patients. As a result, many youngsters have been unable to obtain the drug and, for the few exceptions, insurance carriers won't cover its cost of $6,400 a year.

Good service programs require recruitment, screening, training and supervision - all of high quality. They involve stipends to participants. Full-time residential programs also require housing and full-time supervision; they are particularly expensive - more per participant than a year at Stanford or Yale. Non-residential programs are cheaper, but good ones still come to some $10,000 a year. Are they worth that?

Ford is willing to bid for 100% of Jaguar's shares if both the government and Jaguar shareholders agree to relax the anti-takeover barrier prematurely. As Jaguar's biggest holder and Britain's biggest car maker, Ford could turn up the heat by convening a special shareholders' meeting and urging holders to drop the limits early.

This law aids hurricane-wracked locales named by the president as disaster areas, as well as regions so designated after other 1989 disasters.

Amending a 1988 return to claim a refund brings cash faster; but for personal losses, there are other factors to consider, notes publisher Prentice Hall.

Section 605 also imposes unconstitutional conditions on the president's ability to nominate candidates of his choosing. The language of the appropriations rider implies that any nomination to any position of a rejected nominee will result in the president being denied funding to pay that person's salary. The president could probably not avoid this restriction by choosing people willing to serve without pay, because the Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits voluntary service to the government.

Wall Street is understandably skeptical. Through the first nine months of the year, Kidder ranks a distant 10th among underwriters of U.S. stocks and bonds, with a 2.8% market share, up slightly from 2.5% in the year-earlier period, according to Securities Data Co. It's quite a fall from the early 1980s, when Kidder still was counted as an investment-banking powerhouse. Gary S. Goldstein, president of the Whitney Group, an executive search firm, said: “I'd like to see (Kidder) succeed. But they have to attract good senior bankers who can bring in the business from day one.”

The usual problem with including communists in “interim” coalition governments is that their ideology and methods require they squeeze out everyone else. Recall that Nicaragua's Sandinistas came into Managua as partners in a coalition government with anti-Somoza moderates. Within two years, the moderates were exiled or in prison, Nicaragua had gone communist, and the Sandinistas were building one of the biggest armies in Latin America and threatening their neighbors. In Laos, when the Western powers bowed to pressure for such a coalition it turned out they were opening the door to communist domination. Even Mao Tse-tung's China began in 1949 with a partnership between the communists and a number of smaller, non-communist parties.

It turned out that although it took all five genes to produce the toxin, only one was responsible for the toxin's virulence.

While brand loyalty is far from dead, marketing experts say it has eroded during the 1980s. Marketers themselves are partly to blame: They've increased spending for coupons and other short-term promotions at the expense of image-building advertising. What's more, a flood of new products has given consumers a dizzying choice of brands, many of which are virtually carbon copies of one other.

Wall Street's New Guard isn't likely to take all this lying down for long, however. Its new products and trading techniques have been highly profitable.

Proper English bells are started off in “rounds,” from the highest-pitched bell to the lowest - a simple descending scale using, in larger churches, as many as 12 bells. Then, at a signal, the ringers begin varying the order in which the bells sound without altering the steady rhythm of the striking. Each variation, or change, can occur only once, the rules state. Ringers memorize patterns of changes, known as “methods,” which have odd-sounding names like Kent Treble Bob Major or Grandsire Caters. A series of 5,000 or so changes is a “peal” and takes about three hours.

3:25 a.m. MACPOST: Downtown Bolinas seems to be the part of town that's worst off. No power, minimal phones, and a mess of mayonnaise, wine, and everything else all over the floors of the big old general store and the People's Co-op. The quivers move through my house every few minutes at unpredictable intervals, and the mouse that's been living in my kitchen has taken refuge under my desk. It runs out frantically now and then, and is clearly pretty distressed.

At GMAC, net dropped 3.1% to $234.5 million from $241.9 million. The finance unit attributed the decline to higher borrowing costs compared with a year earlier. GMAC said its automotive financing and leasing business rose 35% in the U.S., largely because of dealer and customer incentives used to boost sales. GMAC profits are combined with earnings from the rest of GM's operations and attributed to the company's traditional common stock.

Mr. Phillips and Mr. Roman are indeed quite similar in substance, if not in style. While Mr. Roman is a workaholic detailsman, Mr. Phillips would rather delegate, leaving him time for his interests outside the office. Mr. Roman, by contrast, seems rarely to cut loose at all, although he did appear at Ogilvy's Halloween party Friday decked out in duck feet and a duck hat, costumed as a “lame duck.”

The new PaineWebber commercial, created with ad agency Saatchi & Saatchi Co., features Mary Farrell, one of the firm's most visible investment strategists, sounding particularly bullish. Taped just as the market closed yesterday, it offers Ms. Farrell advising, “We view the market here as going through a relatively normal cycle .... We continue to feel that the stock market is still the place to be for long-term appreciation.” The spot was scheduled to appear three times on CNN last night.

“The times are my times,” says Mr. Florio. The Camden County congressman still carries himself with a trademark “I'm-coming-down-your-throat” intensity, but at a pause in Newark's Columbus Day parade recently, he was dancing with his wife in the middle of the avenue in the city's old Italian-American ward. After losing by fewer than 1,800 votes in the 1981 governor's race, he has prepared himself methodically for this moment, including deciding in recent years he could no longer support curbs on federal funding for Medicaid abortions.

“The capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping,” and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically, as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas, said Ronald Watkins, vice president for government and industry relations with Interprovincial's parent, Interhome Energy Inc. Mr. Watkins said volume on Interprovincial's system is down about 2% since January and is expected to fall further, making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid-1990s.

Deal stocks led the market down as they absorbed the heaviest losses. UAL, which triggered the slide, opened Monday at $224, down about 20% from Thursday's close. AMR opened Monday at $80, down nearly 20% from Thursday's close. (Both took further hits yesterday.) Hilton lost 20% on Friday; Paramount lost almost 11%. A careful look reveals that where deal financing has been secured, the target's stock price was not affected on Friday. The multibillion-dollar prospects, where the bidder must line up a consortium of banks and\/or issue billions in high-yield debt, were where the damage was concentrated.

Five years of rapid expansion under American Brands, with an emphasis on marketing the agency's services instead of improving them, had hurt Pinkerton's profits, Mr. Wathen claims. He says his team couldn't tell whether accounts receivable had been paid or not. Pinkerton's had locked itself into low-price contracts to win new business, with no hope of profitability until the contracts expired, he adds. And regional offices were “egregiously overstaffed,” he claims. One office had 19 people doing the work of three, “and half of the employees had company automobiles.”

Specific-Time Order: This type of order couples many of the orders described above with instructions that the order must be carried out at or by a certain time. “On the close” can be added to many types of orders. For example, “market-on-close orders” must be filled during the last few minutes of trading for the day at a price that is within the official closing range of prices as determined by the exchange. “Stop-close-only orders” are stop orders that only become active during the closing minutes of trading. “Day orders” expire at the end of the day on which they are entered, “good-till-canceled orders” have no expiration date.

This quarter's loss includes pretax charges of $4.9 million on the proposed discontinuation of the company's troubled British subsidiary, and $3.7 million of other write-offs the company said were non-recurring and principally related to inventory, publishing advances and pre-publication costs. The publishing concern said it retained the investment banking firm of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Inc. to act as its financial adviser, assisting in the evaluation of various financial and strategic alternatives, including debt refinancing, raising capital, recapitalization, a merger or sale of the company.

The consensus view on September leading indicators calls for a gain of 0.3%, the same as in August. Economists said greatly increased consumer optimism, a larger money supply and higher stock prices helped lift the index. All orders-related components, such as consumer-goods orders and building permits, are thought to have been weaker.

The initiative seems to have been crafted to include all the hot issues that set off the wealthy Hollywood weepers who donate money. And it allows Mr. Van de Kamp to get around campaign spending limits. He can spend the legal maximum for his campaign; all the spending for the Van de Kamp initiative (on which there are no limits) is gravy. This initiative is being labeled The Big Green, but maybe it should be called The Big Greenback. (The Republican candidate, Sen. Pete Wilson, is playing the initiative fundraising game too, sponsoring his own crime initiative.)

The researchers also pulled off a second genetic engineering trick in order to get male-sterile plants in large enough numbers to produce a commercial hybrid seed crop. They attached a second gene, for herbicide resistance, to the pollen-inhibiting gene. Both genes are then inserted into a few greenhouse plants, which are then pollinated and allowed to mature and produce seed.
