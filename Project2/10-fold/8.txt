Back then, Mr. Pinter was not only the angry young British playwright, but also the first to use silences and sentence fragments and menacing stares, almost to the exclusion of what we previously understood to be theatrical dialogue.

In the 1980s, the Justice Department and lower federal courts that enforce the Voting Rights Act have required state legislatures and municipal governments to create the maximum number of “safe” minority election districts - districts where minorities form between 65% and 80% of the voting population.

At Greenville High School, meanwhile, some students - especially on the cheerleading squad - were crushed. “It's hard to explain to a 17-year-old why someone they like had to go,” says Mrs. Ward. Soon, T-shirts appeared in the corridors that carried the school's familiar red-and-white GHS logo on the front. On the back, the shirts read, “We have all the answers.” Many colleagues are angry at Mrs. Yeargin. “She did a lot of harm,” says Cathryn Rice, who had discovered the crib notes. “We work damn hard at what we do for damn little pay, and what she did cast unfair aspersions on all of us.”

The volatility inherent in program trading troubled other traders, too. They don't like the risks they are forced to assume when prices swing so drastically. Market makers are supposed to keep supplies of stocks on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur. That means that on days when prices are tumbling and sellers abound they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will. In such an environment, a market maker can absorb huge losses.

The sale, which had been expected, is part of KKR's program to pay down $5 billion of a $6 billion bridge loan by February. Roughly $2 billion of that debt has already been repaid from previous asset sales, and RJR expects to use another $2 billion from the pending, two-part sale of most of its Del Monte unit.

The Fifth Amendment states in relevant part that no person “shall be compelled, in any criminal case, to be a witness against himself.” This privilege against self-incrimination precludes the drawing of an adverse inference against a criminal defendant who chooses not to testify. Thus, in a criminal case, a prosecutor can not comment on a defendant's failure to testify nor can the defendant be compelled to take the stand as a witness, thus forcing him to “take the Fifth.” The privilege, however, has been limited in accordance with its plain language to protect the defendant in criminal matters only.

Chicago & North Western Acquisition Corp. - $475 million of senior subordinated resettable debentures, due Oct. 15, 2001, priced at par to yield 14.75%. The coupon will be reset in one year at a rate that will give the issue a market value of 101. However, the maximum coupon rate on the issue when it is reset can only be 15.5%. Debenture holders will also receive the equivalent of 10% of the common stock of CNW Holdings. The equity kicker is not attached to the offering, but underwriters said it will be offered after a filing for 68,548 common shares of CNW Holdings is declared effective by the Securities & Exchange Commission. The issue is noncallable for five years and has a sinking fund starting in 2000 to retire 50% of the issue before maturity. Rated single-B-2 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and single-B-minus by Standard & Poor's Corp., the issue will be sold through underwriters led by Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.

Fundamental factors are at work as well. Muni bond holders are worried about the impact of a slowing economy on tax revenue, at a time when many state and local governments already face budget deficits and huge spending needs. The recent natural disasters, and the need of many other cities to rebuild crumbling infrastructure, suggests that supply of new issues will continue to rise sharply - even as demand tapers off.

This year, the NFL also imposed an 80-player limit on teams going into training camp, down from 120, in a move meant to trim payroll costs. And the league is trying to get more for its three-year national network contract, which expires after this season. The current contract pays the NFL $1.4 billion. Owners say they expect the league to demand a 50% increase, despite the fact that televised football games have had lackluster ratings. An NFL spokesman also says the league will probably expand its offerings to cable TV companies like ESPN.

Psychologists say isolated people who don't discuss their investments with others are particularly at risk for fraud. Scam artists seek out such people - or try to make sure that their victims isolate themselves. For instance, salesmen may counter a man's objection that he wants to discuss an investment with his wife by asking, “Who wears the pants in your family?” Or an investor who wants his accountant's advice may be told, “You seem like a guy who can make up his own mind.”

The collection was at the heart of a grandiose plan Mr. Paul had in which the art was to do double duty - as an investment for CenTrust and as decoration for the S&L's new office tower, designed by I.M. Pei. The rub is that the $28 million was plucked from the funds of this federally insured institution even as CenTrust was losing money hand over fist. Mr. Paul had no right to buy art for the S&L in the first place - it isn't on the comptroller's “permissible” list - without seeking a special dispensation, which he did not do. Besides that, some of the paintings that were to grace the walls of CenTrust actually ended up hanging in the chairman's estate on La Gorce Isle off Miami Beach.

Increasingly careful attempts to measure neutrons, which would be strong evidence of fusion reactions, continue to be negative. Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons initially reported indirect evidence of neutrons being produced in their experiment but later conceded the measurements were questionable. Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M., reported they went so far as to take a “cold fusion” experiment and three neutron detectors into a tunnel under 300 feet of granite to shield the detectors from cosmic rays. A number of times they detected neutrons in one, sometimes two, of the three detectors, but only once during 411 hours of the experiment did they detect a neutron burst in all three detectors - and they think that was a spurious event.

Third-quarter net income at Texaco rose to $305 million from $274 million last year. Revenue declined 3.4%, to $8.4 billion from $8.7 billion.

USAir's deal with Mr. Buffett “wasn't exactly a shining example of shareholder democracy,” Mr. Steinhardt says. Since last April, the investor has made seven so-called 13D filings in USAir, as he bought and sold the company's stock. Such disclosures of big holdings often are used by raiders to try to scare a company's managers, and to stir interest in the stock. But of course it would be highly unusual for an investment fund such as Steinhardt Partners to take over a company.

While the model was still on view, Manhattan Community Board 1 passed a resolution against South Gardens. The Parks Council wrote the BPCA that this “too “private” ... exclusive,” complex and expensive “enclosed garden ... belongs in almost any location but the waterfront.” Lynden B. Miller, the noted public garden designer who restored Central Park's Conservatory Garden, recalls her reaction to the South Gardens model in light of the public garden she was designing for 42nd Street's Bryant Park: “Bryant Park, as designed in 1933, failed as a public space, because it made people feel trapped. By removing the hedges and some walls, the Bryant Park Restoration is opening it up. It seems to me the BPCA plan has the potential of making South Gardens a horticultural jail for people and plants.”

- FINANCES. Emergency measures would be introduced to ease the country's financial crisis, notably its $200 billion budget deficit. By the end of next year, all loss-making state enterprises would be put out of business or handed over to workers who would buy or lease them or turn them into cooperatives. Similar steps would be taken to liquidate unprofitable state and collective farms by the end of 1991. A unified system of taxation should be introduced rapidly. To mop up some of the 300 billion rubles in circulation, the government should encourage home ownership, including issuing bonds that guarantee holders the right to purchase an apartment.

The branch sale is the centerpiece of CenTrust's strategy to transform itself into a traditional S&L from a high-flying institution that relied heavily on securities trading for profits, according to Mr. Paul. Most analysts and thrift executives had expected a decision on the proposed transaction, which was announced in July, long before now. Many interpret the delay as an indication that regulators are skeptical about the proposal. Branches and deposits can be sold at a premium in the event federal regulators take over an institution.

COPPER: Futures prices partially recovered Monday's declines because Chilean miners voted to strike. The December contract rose 1.20 cents a pound to $1.14. In Chile, workers at two copper mines, Los Bronces and El Soldado, which belong to the Exxon-owned Minera Disputada, yesterday voted to begin a full strike tomorrow, an analyst said. Reasons for the walkout, the analyst said, included a number of procedural issues, such as a right to strike. The analyst noted that also inherent in all metal markets was a sympathetic reaction to stocks. In the case of copper, he said, the upbeat mood of stocks was reflected in demand for futures contracts because a stronger economy means greater buying interest for the metal. Also contributing to the firmness in copper, the analyst noted, was a report by Chicago purchasing agents, which precedes the full purchasing agents' report that is due out today and gives an indication of what the full report might hold. The Purchasing Management Association of Chicago's October index rose to 51.6% after three previous months of readings below 50%. The September index was 47.1%. A reading below 50% generally indicates a slowing in the industrial sector of the economy, while a reading above 50% points to expansion. The Chicago report raised the possibility that the October survey of the National Association of Purchasing Management would also show a reading above 50%.

When a regional economy catches cold, the local real-estate market gets pneumonia. In other words, real-estate market indicators, such as building permits and leasing activity, plummet much further than a local economy in recession. This was seen in the late 1960s in Los Angeles and the mid-1970s in New York. But the reverse is also true: When a region's economy rebounds from a slowdown, these real-estate indicators will rebound far faster than the improving economy.

Worse, Congress has started to jump on the Skinner bandwagon.

The Oct. 13 plunge was triggered not by program traders, but by news of the unraveling of the $6.79 billion buy-out of UAL Corp. Unable to unload UAL and other airline shares, takeover-stock speculators, or risk arbitragers, dumped every blue-chip stock they had. While program trades swiftly kicked in, a “circuit breaker” that halted trading in stock futures in Chicago made some program trading impossible. Susan Del Signore, head trader at Travelers Investment Management Co., says critics are ignoring “the role the {takeover stock} speculator is taking in the market as a source of volatility.” Many arbs are “overleveraged,” she says, and they “have to sell when things look like they fall apart.”

Worries about China came just as Hong Kong's toy industry was recovering from a 1987 sales slump and bankruptcy filings by two major U.S. companies, Worlds of Wonder Inc. and Coleco Industries Inc. Hong Kong manufacturers say large debt writeoffs and other financial problems resulting from the 1987 difficulties chastened the local industry, causing it to tighten credit policies and financial management. The industry regards last year and this year as a period of recovery that will lead to improved results. Still, they long for a “mega-hit” toy to excite retail sales in the U.S., Hong Kong's biggest market for toys and games.

The Mitsubishi family company acquired that property from the government some 100 years ago when it was a portion of samurai residential land running from the moat of the Imperial Palace east toward the hodgepodge of tiny shops and twisted alleys that made up the merchants' district. At the time, Japan had just opened its doors to the world after about 250 years of isolation and needed a Western-style business center. Mitsubishi built the government's dream development, the story goes, in exchange for the official decision to locate Tokyo's central railway station there.

Jutting out just to the north of us is the Blackjack Peninsula (after the oak, not the game) which forms the core of the Aransas Wildlife Refuge. It is famous as the winter home of the whooping crane, that symbol of the destruction of wild America. Last year a gunner shot a whooper by mistake thinking that it was a snow goose. He paid an immense fine and was lucky, according to a local wag, to escape the gas chamber.

In a brief comment before the speech, he said he was “surprised” that some people interpreted his recent comments in Moscow “as endeavoring to say something about current monetary or foreign exchange policies.” While visiting Moscow last week, the Fed chairman had warned that “attempts to maintain unrealistic exchange rates” may be destabilizing - a comment some interpreted as criticism of the Treasury's efforts to push down the dollar.

Mr. Fournier said Navigation Mixte's 1989 unconsolidated, or parent-company, profit is likely to be 4.7 billion francs ($754.4 million), up from 633.8 million francs last year. That is due mostly to payments from Allianz for most of the 50% stake it has agreed to acquire in Navigation Mixte's insurance business. Mr. Fournier said the exceptional gain would mean nearly twice as high a dividend this year as last. If holders avoid tendering to Paribas, he added, they can expect strong dividends again next year.

The limits to legal absurdity stretched another notch this week when the Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal from a case that says corporate defendants must pay damages even after proving that they could not possibly have caused the harm. We can understand and share the compassion that makes judges sometimes wish to offer a kind of Solomonic aid to those who've been hurt. But this case is a stark lesson in how the failures of the traditional policy-making process have left the courts as the only forum this country has to debate risk, technology and innovation. Too often now, a single court decision becomes the precedent for other, less compelling cases.

Revenue-short states also are becoming more aggressive pursuers of tax delinquents, and perhaps none tracks them down with more relish than does New York since it acquired an $80 million computer system in 1985.

Thus armed for massive matching of documents by computer, they single out high-income groups, looking primarily for people who haven't filed New York income-tax returns.

Nissan hopes that that will start to change this fall, with its new version of the Stanza compact sedan. The Stanza has been a nonentity compared with Honda's hugely successful Accord and Toyota's Camry. But this year, Honda has revamped the Accord and made it a midsized car. Nissan instead has kept its new Stanza a bit smaller than that and cut the base price 6%; at $11,450, Stanza prices start $749 below the predecessor model yet have a more-powerful engine.

Last week came news of alarm in Venice over a plan to tap gas fields off the city's coast.

The consortium of scientists and companies was set up by Italy to help preserve the fabled city of canals. Venice has sunk 10 inches in this century.

Despite the dire assessments of knowledgeable garden professionals, Ms. Bartlett's South Gardens design somehow continues on, seemingly impervious to reason, stalled only by bureaucratic lethargy and logistical complications. BPCA President and CEO David Emil hopes to negotiate a seawall that could “be significantly more visually permeable.” And by substituting yet another landscape architect, Nicholas Quennell, he insists he can achieve that and other accommodations to gardening reality while still preserving the “artistic vision” of a “truly great artist.” After four years of no progress in this direction, it is doubtful any viable collaboration with Ms. Bartlett will suddenly now be possible.

The new breed of team owner, Mr. Jones included, has been fighting the NFL bureaucracy for a greater say in league affairs, and the battle has produced a form of organizational gridlock. In July, 11 NFL owners, almost all of them new, blocked an effort to install Jim Finks as a replacement for retiring league commissioner Pete Rozelle. Mr. Finks is perceived by some owners as a standard-bearer for the Old Guard. Earlier this month, another effort to choose a commissioner failed. The owners meet again tomorrow.

State loan guarantees are rarely a source of controversy. However, some bankers cited possible parallels between the Waertsilae Marine case and the collapse of Norway's state-owned Kongsberg Vappenfabrikk AS two years ago. In that case, international banks and investors incurred big losses because they incorrectly believed the company's debt carried implicit state guarantees.

Some charity officials now say Congress should exempt nonprofit organizations that receive land donations from any cleanup liability.

Your Oct. 6 editorial “The Ill Homeless” referred to research by us and six of our colleagues that was reported in the Sept. 8 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. Your comments implied we had discovered that the “principal cause” of homelessness is to be found in the large numbers of mentally ill and substance-abusing people in the homeless population. We have made no such statement. It is clear that most mentally ill people and most alcoholics do not become homeless. The “causes” of homelessness are poorly understood and complex in any individual case.

One such proposal regarding stock-index futures is an increase in the margin requirement - or the “good-faith” payment of cash needed to trade them - to about the same level as the margin requirement for stocks. Currently, margins on stock futures purchases are much lower - roughly 7% compared with 50% for stocks - making the futures market much faster and potentially more speculative. Program trading critics also want the Federal Reserve Board, rather than the futures industry, to set such margins.

While some in the U.S. contend that advertising is the bane of television, here many believe that its absence is to blame for the European TV industry's sluggish development. Until recently, national governments in Europe controlled most of the air time and allowed little or no advertising. Since production costs were guaranteed, it didn't matter that a program couldn't be sold abroad or put into syndication, as most American programs are. But not much money was spent on the shows, either, a situation that encouraged cheap-to-make talk and game shows, while discouraging expensive-to-produce dramas.

They said the president conceded the notification requirement didn't affect his decision to lend only minor support to this month's Panama coup effort. No notification was ever considered, officials said, apparently because the U.S. didn't think the coup plotters intended to kill Mr. Noriega, but merely sought to imprison him.

Yesterday, the Fed executed four-day matched sales, a technical trading operation designed to drain reserves from the banking system. The move was interpreted by some economists as a sign that the Fed doesn't want the federal funds rate to move any lower than the 8 3\/4% at which it has been hovering around during the past week.

But why art? Are we talking pure aesthetic appreciation here? For many buyers, that still is major motivation. But the stakes are now very high and for your $40 million you can buy only the best of what is available - which may not be the best there is.

So it wasn't surprising that Mr. Jones returned to his Arkansas roots when he went looking for a replacement for Mr. Landry. He tapped Jimmy Johnson, a teammate on the 1964 University of Arkansas squad and the head coach at the University of Miami, where he led the Hurricanes to five winning seasons and a national championship in 1987. Whatever Mr. Johnson's talents, in the hearts and minds of many Dallas fans, he is no Tom Landry. Seven games (and, after a loss to the Kansas City Chiefs yesterday, seven losses) into the season, the “new” Cowboys aren't doing any better than the old. In fact, the last time they played this badly was in 1960, their opening season. Average attendance at their games, about 49,000 last year, continues flat.

The monetary tax benefit of indexation for all gains in excess of inflation can be measured using the following equation: tax rate, times inflation rate, times basis for the gain. Depending on the size of the gain and the rate of inflation, indexation can mean a lower tax payment than using the 19.6% rate without indexation.

There is a fundamental conflict between providing a subsidy and maintaining the integrity of a credit program. If the program is meant to provide a subsidy, collecting the debt defeats the original goal.

The most controversial of these is stock-index arbitrage, in which traders buy or sell baskets of stocks and offset the position with an opposite trade in stock-index futures to lock in profits. It's the most controversial form of program trading because it can create abrupt price swings in the stock market.

In contrast, credit programs can be appropriate tools to improve the operation of capital markets. For example, legal restrictions on interstate banking once inhibited the supply of credit to the agricultural sector.

COPPER: Futures prices rose, extending Tuesday's gains. The December contract advanced 2.50 cents a pound to $1.1650. Buying for the most part carried over from the previous session, and traders apparently ignored reports that a Chilean mine strike may have ended almost before it began, an analyst said. According to news service reports, most workers at the Disputado mines owned by Exxon Corp. agreed to a new two-year wage contract that includes a 5% increase and other benefits. However, some workers haven't yet accepted the new contract and are continuing negotiations, the analyst said. Separately, Reuter reported that the Papua-New Guinea government urged its Parliament to extend a state of emergency in copper-rich Bougainville Island for two months. The Bougainville copper mine has been inoperative since May 15 because of attacks by native landowners who want Bougainville to secede from Papua-New Guinea.

Many mutual funds have big cash reserves - which they lacked in 1987 - as a cushion against a possible cascade of telephone sell orders today. Fidelity, which was forced to sell $800 million of stocks in the 1987 crash, has quadrupled the cash level of the giant Magellan fund. The Boston firm says redemptions in stock funds since the Friday market drop have equaled less than 15% of those funds' total cash position of about $2 billion.

He adds: “It just hasn't gotten down to the engine room yet.” But the steam may never reach the engine room. For, just as Mr. Giuliani latches on to an issue that has Mr. Dinkins reeling, his campaign desperately needs cash to keep Mr. Ailes's commercials on the air beyond Wednesday or Thursday. To help out this week, the White House is dispatching chief of staff John Sununu and three Cabinet members - HUD's Jack Kemp, Transportation's Samuel Skinner and Treasury's Nicholas Brady, according to Peter Powers, the Giuliani campaign manager.

The “Major Events” strategy, Mr. Pilson says, is designed to notch a place for CBS on the crowded TV dial of the 1990s. It's also a fast fix for an ailing image. He sees flashy sports as the only way the last-place network can cut through the clutter of cable and VCRs, grab millions of new viewers and tell them about other shows premiering a few weeks later. Next October, CBS, for the first time, won't have to start the season against the much-watched American and National baseball league championships and the World Series.

Even before the huge new projects began, the Strip's recent expansion squeezed smaller competitors.

A severe recession could, of course, raise delinquency rates, but so far the current levels of consumer debt don't seem to loom as a major threat.

The year was already shaping up as a difficult one for the recreational vehicle industry, which makes products such as motor homes, travel trailers, folding campers and van conversions. With the exception of van conversions, the industry has seen a decline from 1988's robust sales.

One of Mr. Roberts's observations is that the Bank's own loan portfolio is in deep trouble because of its lending to developing countries. This is just not so. The reality is that Bank finances are rock solid. As of June 30, 1989 - the day our past fiscal year came to a close - only 4.1% of the Bank's portfolio was affected by arrears of over six months. This is an enviably low level. Moreover, the Bank follows a prudent provisioning policy and has set aside $800 million against possible loan losses. For the same fiscal year, by the way, the Bank's net income was a robust $1.1 billion after provisions.

According to several people present at the meeting, Mr. Gorbachev also supported the idea of concluding several commercial accords with the U.S., possibly at his next summit meeting with President Bush.

All this talk of boiler rooms and fraud is unnerving to the city's legitimate business element. Vincent M Ciavarella, regional manager of Property Management Systems, insists he doesn't know of any bogus telemarketers operating in the 1.6 million square feet of office space around Fashion Island that his company leases for Irvine Co., the owner and developer of the project. Mr. Ciavarella has rejected a few prospective tenants who provided “incomplete” financial information and acknowledges that illegitimate operators “are not easily detectable.” (Investigators stress that building owners are victims, too, since boiler rooms often leave without paying rent.)

What the Big Board is considering is re-establishing a “collar” on program trading when the market moves significantly.

Despite his racial advantage, to be a great butler is a heroic calling; one's pantry is “not unlike general's headquarters during a battle.” If, for example, in the midst of a great social occasion (such as an international conference on revising the Versailles Treaty in 1923), one's 72-yearold father, himself a great butler once, should happen to die of a stroke, one must continue to serve the port: “Please don't think me unduly improper in not ascending to see my father in his deceased condition just at this moment. You see, I know my father would have wished me to carry on just now.” It is this kind of dignity and restraint that allows Stevens to declare: “For all its sad associations, whenever I recall that evening today, I find I do so with a large sense of triumph.” We note the imperial public word used to deny private rage and sorrow. That Stevens himself is not grotesque or repellent, but funny and sad and enlightening, is entirely the author's triumph.

A few months ago, the Bush administration decided to stop this cooperation, leaving Radio Costa Rica operating on a shoestring. According to news reports, the abrupt termination was due to fears that VOA transmissions could interfere with the peace process. In the meantime, Russia gave Nicaragua another powerful radio transmitter, which has been installed in the city of Esteli. It is capable of reaching the entire Caribbean area and deep into North America. Perhaps its loud signal may generate some awareness of the Soviet condominium being created in the isthmus thanks to U.S. default.

Although you may have forgotten, public opinion about Gen. Noriega is where it is in large measure because of my investigation of his years of involvement in narcotics smuggling (and simultaneous work as a U.S. operative). The public made up its mind about Gen. Noriega largely as a result of the hearings I chaired in the Subcommittee on Terrorism and Narcotics of the Foreign Relations Committee on Feb. 8, 9, 10 and 11, 1988, and again on April 4, 1988. It was during those hearings that the nation first learned the breadth and depth of Gen. Noriega's criminality, and of his enduring relationships with a variety of U.S. government agencies.

Interest picks up, though, when Mr. Gould gets around to discussing the meaning of the Burgess oddities for the theory of evolution. Not long after the appearance of life, evidently, there was an explosive proliferation in the number of animal designs seen on the earth. The vast majority of them, however, were wiped out by a succession of environmental upheavals that were too sudden and catastrophic for the normal rules of natural selection to operate. Consequently, the winnowing process was like a lottery “in which each group {held} a ticket unrelated to its anatomical virtues.” So much for survival of the fittest.

Having said that, we must caution against an apparent tendency to overstate the case. It is not quite true, for example, that the Mexican government has “privatized” Mexicana de Aviacion, as Mr. Ortiz claims.

How can a company be considered “privatized” if the state is so heavily represented in it? (True, the Mexican government has granted “control” over the airline to a new private consortium, but its propensity to take back what it gives is too well known to permit one to be sanguine.)

That's the conventional theory anyway. In practice, however, the line between interpretation and redefinition of the criminal law long ago began to blur. In particular, a common law of white-collar crime has developed with surprising rapidity over the past decade. For example, although insider trading has long been criminal, it has never been statutorily defined. In 1983, the Supreme Court tried to supply a workable definition in the Dirks v. SEC decision, which found that liability depended on whether the tipper had breached his fiduciary duty to the corporation in order to obtain “some personal gain” and whether the tippee knew or recklessly disregarded this fact.

For instance, witnesses in Voronezh say the pinheaded behemoths and their robot friend, after strolling around the city park, left behind some rocks. Now why, you have to ask yourself, would intelligent beings haul a bunch of rocks around the universe? Or land in Russia so often. In a 1961 incident, a Soviet mail plane disappeared off the radar screen just after radioing its position to ground control in Sverdlovsk. A search party soon found the unscathed aircraft in a forest clearing much too small to have allowed a conventional landing. What's more, the seven mail personnel aboard were missing.

Several big securities firms backed off from program trading a few months after the 1987 crash. But most of them, led by Morgan Stanley & Co., moved back in earlier this year. The most volatile form of program trading is index arbitrage - the rapid-fire, computer-guided buying and selling of stocks offset with opposite trades in stock-index futures and options. The object is to capture profits from fleeting price discrepancies between the futures and options and the stocks themselves.

Typically, these laws seek to prevent executive branch officials from inquiring into whether certain federal programs make any economic sense or proposing more market-oriented alternatives to regulations. Probably the most egregious example is a proviso in the appropriations bill for the executive office that prevents the president's Office of Management and Budget from subjecting agricultural marketing orders to any cost-benefit scrutiny. There is something inherently suspect about Congress's prohibiting the executive from even studying whether public funds are being wasted in some favored program or other.

Mr. Dinkins did fail to file his income taxes for four years, but he insists he voluntarily admitted the “oversight” when he was being considered for a city job. He was on the board of an insurance company with financial problems, but he insists he made no secret of it. The city's Campaign Finance Board has refused to pay Mr. Dinkins $95,142 in matching funds because his campaign records are incomplete. The campaign has blamed these reporting problems on computer errors. And, says Mr. Dinkins, he didn't know the man his campaign paid for a get-out-the-vote effort had been convicted of kidnapping. But, say Mr. Dinkins's managers, he did have an office and his organization did have members.

And so it went through the first half: an ingeniously chosen potpourri of pieces, none longer than five minutes, none that would disturb or challenge a listener. Mr. Stoltzman introduced his colleagues: Bill Douglas, pianist\/bassoonist\/composer and an old buddy from Yale, and jazz bassist Eddie Gomez. An improvisational section was built around pieces by Mr. Douglas, beginning with “Golden Rain,” a lilting, laid-back lead in to the uptempo “Sky,” which gave Mr. Stoltzman the opportunity to wail in a high register and show off his fleet fingers. Bach's “Air” followed. Mr. Stoltzman tied the composer in by proclaiming him “the great improviser of the 18th century,” and then built on the image by joining with Mr. Douglas in some Bach two-part inventions, cleverly arranged for clarinet and bassoon by Mr. Douglas.

A classic example of institutions' hunger for liquidity is portfolio insurance, now widely discredited. Before the 1987 crash, an estimated $60 billion in institutional money was managed under this hedging technique. The idea was to “insure” the value of a portfolio by selling futures when stock prices dropped - eliminating the need to sell the stocks themselves. But in October 1987, when portfolio insurers rushed to sell at the same time, they overwhelmed both the stock and futures markets.

Mr. Stoltzman must have worried that his audience might not be able to take it: He warned us in advance that “New York Counterpoint” lasts 11 1\/2 minutes. He also unfortunately illustrated this intricate, jazzy tapestry with Mr. Pearson's images, this time of geometric or repeating objects, in a kitschy mirroring of the musical structure that was thoroughly distracting from Mr. Reich's piece and Mr. Stoltzman's elegant execution of it. The rest of the concert was more straight jazz and mellow sounds written by Charlie Parker, Ornette Coleman, Bill Douglas and Eddie Gomez, with pictures for the Douglas pieces. It was enjoyable to hear accomplished jazz without having to sit in a smoke-filled club, but like the first half, much of it was easy to take and ultimately forgettable.

RJR's asset sales will be on schedule, too - if the Del Monte deal is successful. In June, RJR got $2.5 billion for its European food units, which it used, along with about $200 million of other proceeds, to pay down about $2 billion of a $6 billion bridge loan. RJR owes another $3 billion on that loan by February. It expects to pay that with roughly $1 billion in sales of assorted small assets (probably including its 20% stake in ESPN, its Butterfinger and Baby Ruth candy bar brands, and its breakfast cereals unit) and $2 billion from the two-part sale of most of Del Monte. A group led by Merrill Lynch & Co. agreed to acquire Del Monte last month, but the agreement is contingent on the securities firm's ability to finance about $350 million of the purchase price, either by selling junk bonds or making a bridge loan.

“When I saw the Lexus sales projections, I got worried,” confesses Takashi Oka, who led the Infiniti development team. But on reflection, Mr. Oka says, he concluded that Nissan is being prudent in following its slow-startup strategy instead of simply copying Lexus. “Infiniti is Nissan's big business move for the 21st century, and we're in no hurry to generate large profits right away,” Mr. Oka says. Despite plans to add two new Infiniti models next year, bringing the total to four, Infiniti won't show profits for at least five years, he adds.

What is the world dollar base? An article on these pages by Mr. Mueller on June 29 touched off the debate with Goldman Sachs. It defined the WDB as not only currency and commercial bank reserves created by the Federal Reserve, but also the sum of dollar reserves held by foreign central banks. “The world dollar base, in fact, is analogous to the world stock of monetary gold under the classical gold standard,” wrote Mr. Mueller. BMC says it was able to predict the rise in inflation in the U.S. early this year from observing rapid growth in the world dollar base. Its recession, or stagflation, forecast is based on the calculation that after growing at a 14% annual rate, the WDB has since come to a standstill.

Thus, a court is poorly positioned to make judgments about the social utility of the expanded rule. For example, in focusing on Mr. Freeman's attempt to gain nonpublic information about a deal's collapse, one does not naturally think about the reverse side of the coin: What if the rumor had been false? Can a security analyst call an investment banker to make certain that a seemingly improbable rumor is in fact false? In the past, not only would reputable professionals have rushed to check out such rumors with the company, but companies listed on the major stock exchanges were encouraged by the exchanges to respond openly to such inquiries from securities analysts. Today, after Mr. Freeman's plea, there is an uncertainty that is both unfair and inefficient.

The issue here may be the soundness of the guarantee. Prepayments, much like mutual-fund purchases, are pooled for investment.

But whatever their advice about timing, none of these experts recommend jettisoning stocks entirely during a recession. For the portion of an investor's portfolio that stays in stocks, professionals have a number of suggestions.

Easy money advocates, however, are adept at spreading economic myths. There is the constant insistence that the Fed could lower interest rates were it not so obstinate. The Fed indeed can lower short-term interest rates by pumping reserves into the banks, but it can't do much about them from there on. If the reserves generate inflation, which is what the Fed fears most right now, interest rates will go up as lenders demand a premium. Enough inflation can ultimately even wipe out the bond market, as it did in Britain in the 1970s, thereby crippling the economy.

No federal court has ruled that the Voting Rights Act protects a white minority, but in June the Justice Department approved a districting plan for Birmingham that carves out three white-majority districts and six black-majority districts. Richard Arrington, Birmingham's black mayor, lamented the consequences. “In the past, people who had to run for office had to moderate their views because they couldn't afford to offend blacks or whites,” he said. “Now you go to districts, you're likely to get candidates whose views are more extreme, white and black, on racial issues.” Two hundred years ago, critics of the new United States Constitution warned that the electoral districts for Congress were too large and encompassed too many different economic interests. A small farmer and a seaport merchant could not be represented by the same spokesman, they said. But James Madison refuted that argument in one of the most celebrated political treatises ever written, No. 10 of the Federalist Papers. Madison explained that a representative's duty was to speak not for the narrow interests of one group but instead for the common good. Large, heterogeneous election districts would encourage good government, said Madison, because a representative would be compelled to serve the interests of all his constituents and be servile to none.

But they search for ways to limit the damage. A third of 439 companies surveyed by the Employee Relocation Council report a rise in 1988 sales losses over 1987. About 72% reimburse for all or some losses. Since 1984, more companies give sales-loss aid, as many real-estate values depreciated, the council says. RJR Nabisco pays up to $30,000 of losses, including improvements. Goodrich won't ensure loss coverage, but will prevent a “catastrophic loss”; it has given some employees the full purchase price when values fell from concern over dangers posed by a disposal site. Federal Express, Dow Chemical, Ford and National City Corp. will buy the home or let the worker sell to an outside firm, but usually won't cover a loss.

Some American officers interpreted his eagerness and studiousness as a sign of loyalty, but they did so falsely. He rose to chief of intelligence in Panama's socalled G-2 in 1970 after providing populist dictator Torrijos the critical support to defeat a coup attempt against him a year earlier. He became Gen. Torrijos's inseparable shadow, and the holder of all Panama's secrets. Mr. Noriega, by now a lieutenant colonel, expanded his contacts to include the Cubans - not to mention the Israelis, the Taiwanese and any other intelligence service that came knocking. When U.S. diplomats complained to the CIA of Col. Noriega's moonlighting, intelligence experts always insisted that his allegiance was first to the Americans.

Rather ominously, rabbit studies reveal that RU-486 can cause birth defects, Lancet, the British medical journal, reported in 1987. However, Dr. Etienne-Emile Baulieu, the French physician who invented RU-486, wrote in a Science magazine article last month that the rabbit-test results could not be duplicated in rats and monkeys. The drug has a three-dimensional structure similar to that of DES, the anti-miscarriage drug that has been linked to cervical and vaginal cancer in some of the daughters of the women who took it.

Republicans are squinting most painfully, at least at first, which is only fair because they've been shielded the most. So long as abortion was a question for litigation, not legislation, Republicans could find political security in absolutism.

The government said consumer prices rose only 0.2% last month. Economists expected twice as large an increase. That news, plus recent signs of economic sluggishness, greatly increases pressure on the Federal Reserve to ease credit further, which in turn would be good news for stocks, investment managers say. “I see a lot of evidence indicating a slower economy, and that means my interest-rate outlook has a downward tilt,” said Garnett L. Keith Jr., vice chairman of Prudential Insurance Co. of America, one of the nation's largest institutional investors. Fed officials probably won't drive down rates immediately, Mr. Keith said. Despite the inflation news, several Fed officials still fear consumer-price pressures will intensify because they insist the economy is stronger than generally believed.

With the February 1987 U.N. accords “relating to Afghanistan,” the Soviet Union got everything it needed to consolidate permanent control. The terms of the Geneva accords leave Moscow free to provide its clients in Kabul with assistance of any kind - including the return of Soviet ground forces - while requiring the U.S. and Pakistan to cut off aid. The only fly in the Soviet ointment was the last-minute addition of a unilateral American caveat, that U.S. aid to the resistance would continue as long as Soviet aid to Kabul did. But as soon as the accords were signed, American officials sharply reduced aid. In February 1989, when the Soviets said they had completed their pullout, the U.S. cut it further.

It is difficult, however, to justify civil disobedience, non-violent or not, where citizens have full recourse to the ballot box to effect change. Where truly representative governments are safeguarded by constitutional protections of human rights and an independent judiciary to construe those rights, there is no excuse for breaking the law because some individual or group disagrees with it. There may be a few cases where the law breaking is well pinpointed and so completely non-invasive of the rights of others that it is difficult to criticize it. The case of Rosa Parks, the black woman who refused to sit at the back of the bus, comes to mind as an illustration. But most cases of non-violent civil disobedience are not nearly so benign.

Biosource Genetics Corp., Vacaville, Calif., is developing a spray containing a gene that spreads from cell to cell and interferes with the genes that are responsible for producing pollen. This gene, called “gametocide,” is carried into the plant by a virus that remains active for a few days. Robert Erwin, president of Biosource, called Plant Genetic's approach “interesting” and “novel,” and “complementary rather than competitive.” “There is a large market out there hungry for hybrid seeds,” he said.

Currently, however, the Transportation Department's authority over leveraged buy-outs appears to some to be a case of too much, too late. The department doesn't have prior-review authority. In addition, if it can't persuade a company to restructure an unacceptable buy-out plan, its only recourse is to revoke the airline's certificate - in effect grounding the carrier. That, says House Aviation Subcommittee Chairman James Oberstar, a Minnesota Democrat, is like “using a howitzer to go deer hunting.”

No garden-variety crime, palm-tree rustling is sprouting up all over Southern California, bringing big bucks to crooks who know their botany. Cycads, the most popular of which is the Sago Palm, are doll-sized versions of California's famous long-necked palms, with stubby trunks and fern-like fronds. Because the Sago is relatively rare and grows only a couple of inches a year, it's a pricey lawn decoration: A two-foot tall Sago can retail for $1,000, and taller ones often fetch $3,000 or more.

Under {RICO}, the government may seek a temporary restraining order (TRO) upon the filing of a RICO indictment, in order to preserve all forfeitable assets until the trial is completed and judgment entered. Such orders can have a wide-ranging impact on third parties who do business with the defendants, including clients, vendors, banks, investors, creditors, dependents, and others. Some highly publicized cases involving RICO TROs have been the subject of considerable criticism in the press, because of a perception that pre-trial freezing of assets is tantamount to a seizure of property without due process. In order to ensure that the rights of all interested parties are protected, the Criminal Division has instituted the following requirements to control the use of TROs in RICO prosecutions. (It should be noted that these requirements are in addition to any other existing requirements, such as review by the Asset Forfeiture Office.):

In 1980, Mr. Guber got together with Mr. Peters, by then a successful producer in his own right, after the death of Mr. Bogart. While Guber Peters produced a number of hits for Warner and others, their record wasn't always so impressive. Among their clinkers were “The Legend of Billie Jean,” “VisionQuest,” “Clue” and “Clan of the Cave Bear.” And the failures make it possible for Warner in its current lawsuit to paint the producers as ingrates. The studio says it stuck with them “even in the early years when the creative partnership was not particularly profitable for Warner.”

These were only two of a series of fabrications that had, in Judge Kozinski's words, the cumulative effect of making Mr. Masson “appear more arrogant, less sensitive, shallower, more self-aggrandizing, and less in touch with reality than he appears from his own statements.” As Robert Coles wrote in a review of Ms. Malcolm's book, Mr. Masson emerges “as a grandiose egotist ... and, in the end, a self-destructive fool.

Though Ms. Pfeiffer has the flashy part - she gets the best comic bits and to wear glamorous dresses and spiked heels the boys are pretty great, too. What seemed like a good idea, to cast the Bridges brothers (Jeff and Beau) as the Baker brothers, actually turned out to be a good idea. Anyone who's tried to appear “natural” in front of a camera knows that it's much more natural to end up looking like a stiff.

The pending bill, introduced by Mr. Thurmond, would revive the long-dormant federal death-penalty laws by instituting legal procedures required by the Supreme Court. In 1972, the high court swept aside all capital-punishment laws - federal and state alike - as unconstitutional. But in 1976, the court permitted resurrection of such laws, if they meet certain procedural requirements. For instance, juries would have to consider specific “aggravating” and “mitigating” factors before deciding whether to condemn someone to death. Since that 1976 ruling, 37 states have reintroduced the death penalty. But congressional Democrats have blocked the same from occurring at the federal level, with the exception of a 1988 law allowing capital punishment for certain drug-related homicides.

The Lok Sabha, or lower house of Parliament, has 542 elected and two appointed seats. In 1984, the Congress (I) captured 405 seats, the largest victory in the history of Indian democracy. The landslide was fueled by panic that prevailed in India at the time. Mrs. Gandhi had been assassinated by separatist Sikhs, and many Indians feared their country might split apart. In the previous three general elections, similar national issues clinched the vote. In 1971, the Congress Party won after India's victory in the Bangladesh war. In 1977, Mrs. Gandhi was thrown out of office after her 19-month emergency rule, and in 1980, after her successors made a mess of their three years in power, she was restored to office.

Republicans acknowledge that few people would be executed under the Thurmond bill, but they contend that isn't the point. “Many scholars are of the opinion that the mere existence of the penalty deters many people from the commission of capital crimes,” says Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah). Executions, regardless of how frequently they occur, are also “proper retribution” for heinous crimes, Mr. Hatch argues. Thomas Boyd, a senior Justice Department official, says the new federal drug-related crimes punishable by death since last November may result in a jump in capital sentences, though that hasn't happened so far.

But in 1986, the badges and the “don't speak out of turn” rule were abolished - early steps in a cultural revolution still rolling on with all the subtlety of a freight train. In recent years, Nissan has instituted flex-time work schedules and allowed employees to dress casually, even in blue jeans. A rule forbidding staffers to own competitors' cars has been lifted, and now many designers drive foreign cars to get useful ideas. Nissan's decades-old corporate song filled with references to Mount Fuji has been scrapped in favor of a snappy tune sung by a popular Japanese vocalist.

State governments place very low ceilings on how much property people may own or how much income they may keep if they want welfare help on medical bills. Conventional wisdom has long held that anywhere from one-fourth to one-half of all elderly long-term care patients are obliged to spend themselves into poverty before qualifying for Medicaid assistance. But separate reports from Joshua Weiner and Denise Spence of the Brookings Institution and Korbin Liu of the Urban Institute find that “a surprisingly small proportion” - only about 10% - of residents start out as private payers but “spend down” to Medicaid levels in a single nursing home stay before they die or are discharged. (Another one-third are already on Medicaid when they enter the nursing homes, a considerably higher proportion than the analysts anticipated.)

At the same time, the strategy requires that he deal effectively with those who seek genuine Western-style political pluralism. The most important development in Mr. Gorbachev's policy for marginalizing the opposition movement is the claim that the U.S.S.R. also suffers from terrorism. An increasing number of references by the Soviet press to opposition groups now active in the U.S.S.R., particularly the Democratic Union, allege that they show “terroristic tendencies” and claim that they would be prepared to kill in order to achieve their aims. It is possible that, in perpetuating such myths, the ground is being laid for the arrest of opposition activists on the ground of terrorism.

But the proposed fine is bound to be controversial.

Back when the Burgess fauna were flourishing, it seems, human evolutionary hopes hung on the survival of a little worm with a backbone called Pikaia. Mr. Gould finds this oddly exhilarating; like an existentialist of old, he views our contingency as “a source of both freedom and consequent moral responsibility.” I, by contrast, can not help feeling that if some other curiosity from the Burgess Shale had survived instead, beings at once wiser and less boorish than Homo sapiens might have eventually gained earthly dominion. But even if no conscious life had evolved here at all, the universe is a big place, and given the right conditions, sympathetic to creating some form of life. Surely at some other cosmic address a Gouldoid creature would have risen out of the ooze to explain why, paleontologically speaking, “it is, indeed, a wonderful life.”

The company said that as part of its agreement with the EPA, it “made certain voluntary undertakings with respect to intercorporate transactions entered into after the reorganization.” The company, which issued a statement on the agreement late Friday, said that $1 million of the payment was previously provided for in its financial statements and that $500,000 will be recognized in its 1989 third-quarter statement. The agreement and consent decree are subject to court approval, the company said.

Mr. Robinson of Delta & Pine, the seed producer in Scott, Miss., said Plant Genetic's success in creating genetically engineered male steriles doesn't automatically mean it would be simple to create hybrids in all crops. That's because pollination, while easy in corn because the carrier is wind, is more complex and involves insects as carriers in crops such as cotton. “It's one thing to say you can sterilize, and another to then successfully pollinate the plant,” he said. Nevertheless, he said, he is negotiating with Plant Genetic to acquire the technology to try breeding hybrid cotton.

Those who aren't worried about how Japanese manufacturers' investments will affect trade note that many new products aren't replacements for imports. Although imports account for less than 1% of beer sales in Japan, Asahi Breweries Ltd., which has been gaining share with its popular dry beer, plans to fend off Japanese competitors by pouring $1.06 billion into facilities to brew 50% more beer. But new-product development will make Japanese companies stronger, and big investments in “domestic” industries such as beer will make it even tougher for foreign competitors to crack the Japanese market.

Why are programs like this not eliminated? “Feeding Frenzy” does provide a few clues. In and around all levels of government in the U.S. are groups of people who can best be described as belonging to a political insider commercial party. They know that whenever government is redistributing wealth, regulating commerce or maintaining a large defense establishment, there is big money to be made in influencing, brokering or selling the processes and decisions of government. They are our version of the East bloc's Nomenklatura and they have absolutely no wish to see anything change. How many government programs and policies exist because they line the pockets of political insiders? This is the real issue raised by the Wedtech scandal.

But despite its hair-trigger edginess, whether the market today will in fact mirror 1987 with a further dive is a far different matter. There are many reasons to think that what appeared Friday is another species of bear, and a less vicious one.

So far, about 150 Orange Workers have moved here, spending nearly $1 million buying up property over the past three years. Still, complete and total segregation remains elusive.

A young man called July (that's when he was born), who works at the railroad station just up the street from the Orange Workers office, points at the whitewalled building and says matter-of-factly, “We're not allowed in there, that's all I know.”

The bond market seemed to ignore evidence that the Federal Reserve eased credit conditions slightly by allowing the federal funds rate to drift as low as 8 1\/2%. The closely watched rate on federal funds, or overnight loans between banks, slid to about 8 3\/4% last week, down from its perceived target level of about 9%. The rate is considered an early signal of changes in Fed policy. Traders said yesterday's modest easing didn't stir much enthusiasm because it had been widely expected. In fact, some economists contend that the latest easing started last week. Others note that some investors were disappointed because they had expected a more aggressive easing.

Clad in his trademark black velvet suit, the soft-spoken clarinetist announced that his new album, “Inner Voices,” had just been released, that his family was in the front row, and that it was his mother's birthday, so he was going to play her favorite tune from the record. He launched into Saint-Saens's “The Swan” from “Carnival of the Animals,” a favorite encore piece for cellists, with lovely, glossy tone and no bite. Then, as if to show that he could play fast as well, he offered the second movement from Saint-Saens's Sonata for Clarinet, a whimsical, puckish tidbit that reflected the flip side of the Stoltzman personality.

But “an eerie silence pervaded” the junk market Friday as prices tumbled on hundreds of high-yield bonds despite “no active trading,” says John Lonski, an economist at Moody's Investors Service Inc. For example, the price of Southland Corp.'s $500 million of 16 3\/4% bonds due 2002 - sold less than two years ago by Goldman, Sachs & Co. - plummeted 25% to just 30 cents on the dollar. But not even Goldman would make a market in the securities of Southland, the owner of the nationwide chain of 7-11 convenience stores that is strapped for cash. Goldman officials declined to comment.

Two Mexican college dropouts, not professional art thieves, have been arrested for a 1985 Christmas Eve burglary from the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City. About 140 Mayan, Aztec, Mixtec and Zapotec objects, including some of Mexico's best-known archaeological treasures, were taken. The government offered a reward for the return of the antiquities, but routine police work led to the recovery. As it turned out, Carlos Perches Trevino and Ramon Sardina Garcia had hidden the haul in a closet in the Perches family's home for a year. Then they took the art to Acapulco and began to trade some of it for cocaine. Information from an arrested drug trafficker led to the two men and the recovery of almost all the stolen art.

France can boast the lion's share of high-priced bottles. Bordeaux's first growths from 1985 and 1986 are $60 to $80 each (except for the smallest in terms of production, Chateau Petrus, which costs around $250!). These prices seem rather modest, however, in light of other French wines from current vintages. Chateau Yquem, the leading Sauternes, now goes for well over $100 a bottle for a lighter vintage like 1984; the spectacularly rich 1983 runs $179.

The Wall Street Journal's “American Way of Buying” survey this year found that most consumers switch brands for many of the products they use. For the survey, Peter D. Hart Research Associates asked some 2,000 consumers, including Mrs. Lombardi, whether they usually buy one brand of a certain type of product or have no brand loyalty. More than half the users of 17 of the 25 products included in the survey said they're brand switchers.

Sassy already has recovered; circulation has quickly passed the 500,000 mark and advertising pages have stabilized this year at more than 300. What's more, Mr. Lang says he has what all publishers wish for: a bona fide niche. “Seventeen is written more for mothers, not their daughters,” said Mr. Lang. “But Sassy has a different spirit. It gets more mail in a month than McCall's got in a year, and it's not from mothers. I feel about Sassy like I did about Working Woman 10 years ago.” Mr. Lang took on Ms. and Sassy with the acquisition of Matilda Publications Inc. by his newly formed Lang Communications. Lang owns 70% of Matilda, while Citicorp owns the rest through its Citicorp Venture Capital Partners. Two weeks ago, Citicorp and Mr. Lang pumped $800,000 into Matilda just to keep the doors open.

Thus, when Mr. Pierce asserted the Fifth in a noncriminal proceeding, particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel, one must conclude that he held a good-faith, justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution.

Drawing the adverse inference in a noncriminal congressional hearing does not offend the Fifth Amendment shield against self-incrimination.

Last summer, in response to congressional criticism, the State Department and the CIA said they had resumed military aid to the resistance months after it was cut off; but it is not clear how much is being sent or when it will arrive. For months the resistance has been defenseless against air attack. Thus far there is no indication that they have been re-supplied with Stingers or other anti-aircraft weapons. Indeed, U.S. officials have indicated to the press that the continuation of aid depends on what success the weakened resistance achieves by the end of this year.

Money's importance is central to a genteel debate now under way between two U.S. monetarist camps over something called the “world dollar base” (WDB). One economic model fashioned out of this concept is predicting a U.S. recession late this year or early next year. Whether the prediction is correct - and with only two months left in 1989 time soon will tell - the debate at least is a useful reminder that the U.S. dollar is not just a national, but an international currency. If U.S. monetary policy goes astray it will have repercussions well beyond those that unseated the estimable Mr. Lawson.

Because UPS drivers aren't permitted to load their own vehicles at the depot, say these couriers, packages often get buried in the load and are delivered late.

The position of the United States, which once contributed 25% of the budget, is that nothing has changed.

Other countries, including West Germany, may have a hard time justifying continued membership.
