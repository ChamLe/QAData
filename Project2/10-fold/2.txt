Yorkshire Bank, which had pretax profit of # 100.4 million and # 3.19 billion in assets last year, has Britain's ninth-largest branch network. It is viewed by market analysts as a potential target for banks aiming to boost their U.K. presence prior to the 1992 development of a single market in financial services in the European Community. Analysts have said the bank could fetch a price of between 8.5 and 10 times pretax profit - or between # 850 million and # 1 billion.

The champion apparently was not worried at all about D.T.'s strong points.

D.T. also has a prodigious and flawless memory, is utterly fearless, and couldn't be distracted by the sexy nude sculptures spread around the playing hall, in the New York Academy of Art. In fact, D.T. never left home, Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, but communicated with its human handlers by telephone link. They conceded that the odds favored Mr. Kasparov, but they put their hope in D.T.'s recently enhanced capacity for examining positions - up to a million per second, from 720,000.

Mr. McDuffie's sweet tone, heartfelt lyricism and rhythmic punch make him an ideal interpreter of both works. Aided by the fluid playing of the St. Louis Symphony under Leonard Slatkin's direction, this “Serenade” really swings. Mr. Schuman's “Violin Concerto,” which sounds more like a mildly atonal rhapsody for solo violin with orchestral accompaniment, meanders until the propulsive “Agitato, fervente.” But there are ample rewards in its plaintive slow sections and virtuoso fireworks for soloist, brass and timpani. At Avery Fisher Hall here, Mr. McDuffie was heard recently with Mr. Menuhin and the Warsaw Sinfonia in more conventional fare - Bruch's overwrought “Violin Concerto in G Minor.” His performance was so effusive and driven that the phrases rarely breathed. The 35-member Sinfonia played adroitly with a big, lush sound that belied its size.

A nickname for measures to stop the market from plunging too far too fast. Several moves were taken following the October 1987 crash to coordinate - and sometimes deliberately disconnect - the stock and futures markets in times of heightened volatility. On the Big Board, a “side car” is put into effect when the S&P futures rise or fall 12 points. The side car routes program trades into a special computer file that scans for imbalances of buy and sell orders. On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, S&P 500 futures are not allowed to fall further than 12 points from the previous day's close for half an hour. If, when trading resumes, the S&P futures fall 30 points from the previous day's close, a one-hour trading halt takes effect. Also, the reforms allow the Big Board to halt trading for one hour if the Dow Jones Industrial Average falls 250 points, and for two more hours if the Dow slides an additional 150 points on the same day.

A Reuters spokesman said the departure reflects “no change in strategy or profits.” Mark Shepperd, an analyst at UBS Phillips & Drew in London, said, “I suspect (the departure) will be fairly irrelevant for the company.

In the U.S. over-the-counter market, American depositary shares for Reuters, each representing three shares in the London market, closed unchanged at $43.875.

When market tremors start, it is crucial that as much information about transaction prices and the supply-demand curve (buy and sell orders at various prices) be made available to all, not just to market makers. Because of a lack of information and access, many investors - including the very ones whose buying power could restore stability and damp volatility - are forced to stand on the sidelines when they are most needed, because of their ignorance of important market information. To add aftershock-damping power to America's markets, a modern, electronic trading system should be implemented that permits equal access to the trading arena (and the information that would automatically accompany such access) by investors - particularly institutional investors.

Mr. Roman said American Express's Mr. Robinson first approached him about the job in late September.

Although it ultimately wasn't offered to him, he will be on retainer to American Express as an adviser on international matters. After talking on and off for the past four weeks, Mr. Roman said, he agreed to take the job because “it's the right time, it's a terrific opportunity, and I think I leave the company in very strong hands.

Insurers typically retain a small percentage of the risks they underwrite and pass on the rest of the losses. Insurers buy this insurance protection for themselves by giving up a portion of the premiums they collect on a policy to another firm - a reinsurance company, which, in turn, accepts a portion of any losses resulting from this policy. Insurers, such as Cigna Corp., Transamerica Corp, and Aetna Life & Casualty Co., buy reinsurance from other U.S.-based companies and Lloyd's of London for one catastrophe at a time.

Earlier this week, a Fifth Circuit appellate panel upheld Judge Maloney's dismissal of Mr. Gaubert's claim as a shareholder but said the judge should reconsider Mr. Gaubert's claim for the loss of his property. “It may depend on whether there was an express or implied promise ... that the federal officials would not negligently cause the deterioration” of Independent American, the court wrote. Mr. Gaubert's lawyer, Abbe David Lowell of Washington, D.C., says the impact of the ruling on other cases involving thrift takeovers will depend on the degree of similarity in the facts. “I don't know if this will affect one institution or a hundred,” Mr. Lowell says. “It does establish a very clear precedent for suing the FHLBB where there was none before.”

Of course, the health of the economy will be threatened if the market continues to dive this week. Sharply falling stock prices do reduce consumer wealth, damage business confidence and discourage the foreign investors upon whom the U.S. now relies for financial sustenance.

At the behest of pro-choice members of Congress, a four-year reauthorization bill for Title X federal family-planning assistance now contains a $10 million grant for “development, evaluation and bringing to the marketplace of new improved contraceptive devices, drugs and methods.” If this passes - a Senate version has already been cleared for a floor vote that is likely early next year - it would put the federal government into the contraceptive marketing business for the first time. It also could put the government into the RU-486 business, which would please feminists dismayed at what they view as pusillanimity in the private-sector drug industry.

Defense lawyers, perhaps understandably, say that plaintiffs' lawyers taking such an approach will have little success in pursuing their claims, though they add that the facts of each case must be looked at individually. “A lot of this is going to be code-related,” says Ignazio J. Ruvolo, a construction law specialist at Bronson, Bronson & McKinnon, a San Francisco law firm. Plaintiffs, he says, will argue that damaged structures weren't built to proper design standards. But if defendants can prove that they met San Francisco's stringent building codes, “that's probably going to protect them,” Mr. Ruvolo says.

Groups representing some independent auto-repair shops join a compromise on the Clean Air legislation worked out between environmentalists and Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.). The plan would increase the warranty on auto-emission systems to eight years or 80,000 miles from five years or 50,000 for major parts. But the warranty on simpler parts would be lowered to two years or 24,000 miles. The garage owners say they would benefit because car owners would be less likely to go back to dealers for the simpler repairs after two years.

But the worriers remain unconvinced. With Japan running enormous trade surpluses against much of the world, they think that Japan should meet the increased domestic demand by importing more.

The appeals court disagreed on both counts. Avondale was notified by Louisiana officials in 1986 that it was potentially responsible for a cleanup at an oil-recycling plant. Avondale asked Travelers to defend it in the state proceeding, but the insurer didn't respond. The appeals court upheld a district judge's ruling that the insurer had to defend the company in such proceedings.

Decades of educational research tell us unequivocally that even smaller classes have zero effect on the academic performance of the pupils - though they may sometimes be desirable for other reasons.

The cases quickly went to court, but the mothers of several thousand DES plaintiffs couldn't recall whose brand they used. Beginning in 1980, courts in several states including California and New York decided to suspend the common-law rule that plaintiffs must prove that the defendants are the ones who are liable. Courts made the assumption that all DES pills were essentially the same, and created a market-share test so that damages would be assessed against drug makers in the proportion of their share of the original sales.

With “Planet News,” music meant to accompany readings of Allen Ginsberg's “Wichita Vortex Sutra,” Mr. Glass gets going. His hands sit farther apart on the keyboard. Seventh chords make you feel as though he may break into a (very slow) improvisatory riff. The chords modulate, but there is little filigree even though his fingers begin to wander over more of the keys. Contrasts predictably accumulate: First the music is loud, then it becomes soft, then (you realize) it becomes louder again. “The Fourth Knee Play,” an interlude from “Einstein on the Beach,” is like a toccata but it doesn't seem to move much beyond its left-hand ground in “Three Blind Mice.”

Two well-known colleagues who believe Mr. Straszheim was right the first time are David Bostian Jr. and A. Gary Shilling, both of whom run their own New York research firms.

For the more than 43 million Americans with disabilities, the 1989 Americans With Disabilities Act provides the missing piece.

It might be alleged that TV has done more than its share to popularize and promote non-violent civil disobedience, so the second situation hypothesized above would be simply a case of “chickens coming home to roost.” Or maybe the TV network would lose nothing. Geraldo or Phil would probably pull up another camera and interview the chained protesters. Let us look for a moment at another type of non-violent civil disobedience that only harms other people indirectly, yet does irreparable damage to the nation as a whole. I am referring to those young men who chose to disobey their country's call to arms during the Vietnam war and fled to Canada or some other sanctuary to avoid combat. Their cowardly acts of civil disobedience, which they tried to hide under the cloak of outrage at a war they characterized as “immoral,” weakened the national fabric and threw additional burdens on those who served honorably in that conflict.

This is what we know at the end of the opening section of “The Storyteller.” The next voice we hear sounds like this: “There was no evil, there was no wind, there was no rain. The women bore pure children. If Tasurinchi wanted to eat, he dipped his hand into the river and brought out a shad flicking its tail ...” And this: “Moving, walking. Keeping on, with or without rain, by land or by water, climbing up the mountain slopes or climbing down the ravines.” The speaker is never identified. He tells his stories in his majestically simple way, in a “language” all his own. There are creation myths and cosmologies and hunting stories - a whole culture is contained within these dreamy narratives. It is as though Mr. Vargas Llosa had recorded a storytelling session at a Machiguenga campfire. And this is just the effect he hopes to have on the reader, as he alternates chapters in his “own” voice with chapters somehow “borrowed” from the Machiguenga storyteller.

The declines in investment and efficiency explain in part why Mexico has been importing gasoline this year.

Mr. Moon planned to convert millions of Americans to his unique brand of Christianity - in which he plays the role of Old Testament-style temporal, political messiah - and then to make the U.S. part of a unified international theocracy. His original strategy (in itself a brilliant innovation for spreading a religion) was to create new economic enterprises each time he wanted to extend and fund his various religious missions. Tax-exempt airport and street-corner solicitations were intended only to provide start-up funds. More stable industries were to build an economically viable infrastructure for the Moon movement in North America, as they had in Japan and South Korea. Then he would move his movement to Europe.

The university had sued Connaught, arguing its directors had broken a 1972 agreement not to sell the company to a foreign concern by recommending Merieux's offer to shareholders. A decision in the case, heard last week by the Ontario Supreme Court, is expected this week.

Yet the bill is riding high on the furor over drug trafficking. Senate Republicans, after repeatedly failing to attach death-penalty amendments to unrelated legislation, have finally gotten a full-blown death-penalty bill through committee. The Democratic leadership agreed to allow a floor vote on the issue before the end of the year - a debate certain to focus on the alleged racial inequality of death sentencing. Even some Democrats concede that there is probably a majority in the Senate that favors some kind of broad capital-punishment measure.

Moreover, companies have sold off many of their smaller, less-profitable hospitals and have completed painful restructurings. Humana's revenues, for example, are being boosted by large increases in enrollments in the company's health maintenance organizations.

Mexico, with its desperate need for investment, and Japan, with its huge budget surplus, would seem like a perfect match.

Also in New York, Israel Silverman, an insurance-company lawyer, comments that program trading “increases volatility, but I don't think it should be banned. There's no culprit here. The market is just becoming more efficient.” Arbitraging on differences between spot and futures prices is an important part of many financial markets, he says. He adds that his shares in a company savings plan are invested in a mutual fund, and volatility, on a given day, may hurt the fund. But “I'm a long-term investor,” he says. “If you were a short-term investor, you might be more leery about program trading.”

Although Sotheby's points out that it is “an international organization” not specifically concerned with potential losses to American museums, others are up in arms: “Donations have always been the main source of increased museum collections,” says Edward H. Able Jr., executive director of the American Association of Museums. “Now there is a hemorrhaging of this country's patrimony.” According to a study conducted by the Association of Art Museum Directors, the drop in the dollar value of donated works of art since 1986 is more than 50%. “This is just the tip of the iceberg, because no major collector has died recently,” says Christopher Burge, president of Christie's America. “The next 10 years are going to be a wasteland for American museums.”

Aid was also the gist of the talks Sen. Dodd had with Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani; Mr. Cristiani's government is very much at the mercy of U.S. largess and is forced to listen very carefully to Sen. Dodd's likes and dislikes. It was therefore not surprising that close allies of the U.S., virtually neglected by the Bush administration, ordered the Nicaraguan insurgents dismantled by December, long before the elections. Fittingly, the Tela Accords were nicknamed by Hondurans “the Dodd plan.”

In contrast to previous economic booms, Japanese auto companies aren't just trying to boost production. Many are pouring money into developing high-quality products to target affluent consumers and, to some extent, to avoid direct combat with cheaper cars from South Korea and Taiwan. Others are replacing older facilities with flexible assembly lines on which different models can be turned out at once. So many companies are investing in high-tech machinery that Fanuc Ltd., a robot maker, also had to build a new plant. The buildup is “making Japan clearly more efficient, more technologically advanced and more competitive,” declares a Western diplomat in Tokyo.

Often, Mr. Dinkins's procrastination prevented him from having a say in the way things turned out, critics claim. On the campaign stump, he often points out that he was the only Board of Estimate member to vote against a controversial real-estate project at Manhattan's Columbus Circle. But board members say he took so long to decide how to vote that by the time he decided, it was too late to try to draw other members to his position. Says one city official: “Everybody else had brought in the wagons and made their deal. He would have got a lot more done if he made up his mind faster.”

Separately, the bill gives authority to the Department of Housing and Urban Development to facilitate the refinancing of high-interest loans subsidized by the government under the so-called Section 235 home-ownership program for lower-income families. This provision met early and strong resistance from investment bankers worried about disruptions in their clients' portfolios. But the promise of at least $15 million in new savings helped to forge a partnership between HUD Secretary Jack Kemp and lawmakers wanting to protect their projects elsewhere.

Investors have complained for some time about program trading, particularly index arbitrage, to little avail. But according to some Big Board traders, an organized campaign from exchange-listed companies might make the exchange finally consider big changes. “They won't fight the listed companies. Now the assault is on,” said one top trader. The Big Board can't ban stock-index futures, of course, but it could ban use of its high-speed electronic trading system for program trading or at least encourage securities firms to back off. The exchange put a bit of a damper on program trading when, last year, it simply started to publish monthly statistics of each firm's program-trading volume.

After Friday's decline, Mr. Perritt's firm ran statistical tests on 100 high-quality stocks, using old-fashioned value criteria devised by Benjamin Graham, an analyst and author in the 1930s and 1940s who is widely considered to be the father of modern securities analysis. He found 85 still overvalued and 15 fairly valued.

That's not to say that the nutty plot of “A Wild Sheep Chase” is rooted in reality. It's imaginative and often funny. A disaffected, hard-drinking, nearly-30 hero sets off for snow country in search of an elusive sheep with a star on its back at the behest of a sinister, erudite mobster with a Stanford degree. He has in tow his prescient girlfriend, whose sassy retorts mark her as anything but a docile butterfly. Along the way, he meets a solicitous Christian chauffeur who offers the hero God's phone number; and the Sheep Man, a sweet, roughhewn figure who wears - what else - a sheepskin.

About the only major steelmaker expected to post improved results is USX Corp., which once again will post gains from asset sales.

The expected $1 billion-plus proceeds are expected to be used to reduce debt and buy back shares. One wild card in USX's future earnings is investor Carl Icahn, who boosted his stake in USX and is urging more restructuring.

Security at a typical Haagen inner-city center is impressive, but unobtrusive. The entire site is enclosed by a 6-to-8-foot-high ornamental iron fence with a small number of remote-controlled gates. Shrubs and flowers give it a pleasing and non-fortress-like appearance. Infrared motion detectors and closed-circuit TV cameras monitor the entire center; lighting levels are three to five times the industry standard. The security command post, camouflaged as second-story retail space, has its own “crow's nest” above the roofs of the other buildings, with a panoramic view of the entire center. Local law enforcement is present in a sub-station occupying space donated by the center. These features are also used in Matanky Realty Group's Grand Boulevard Plaza. Haagen has its own large security force of well-trained and well-paid personnel on round-the-clock duty at each center. Security is 60% to 70% of the common area charges of these centers, vs. an industry average of about 15%.

The common view, says Abby Cohen, strategist for Drexel Burnham Lambert, is that there will be “mild economic growth, modest profit expansion, and things are going to be hunky-dory.

DRUG WARS: A Texas legislator proposes color-coding drivers' licenses of some drug offenders. The bill would authorize courts to order the licenses as a condition of probation. State Senator J.E. “Buster” Brown, a Republican who is running for Texas attorney general, introduced the bill. He said an altered license would be an “embarrassment” to teenagers and young adults and would act as a deterrant to drug use. Richard Avena, executive director of the Texas Civil Liberties Union, called the proposal “political gimmickry,” and said it fails to recognize the drug problem as a health issue.

Some of his observations about Japanese management style are on the mark.

Tuesday's rout of a GOP congressional hopeful in a Mississippi district that hasn't backed a Democratic presidential candidate since Adlai Stevenson is another reminder that, at least at the federal level, political “ticket splitting” has been on the rise over the past half century. In only one presidential election year prior to 1948 did more than 20% of the nation's congressional districts choose a different party's candidate for the White House than for the House of Representatives. Now that percentage routinely equals a third and twice has been above 40%.

In a foreign-policy address before the Soviet legislature, the foreign minister conceded that the radar station in Krasnoyarsk breached the superpower Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty and said it would be dismantled. Shevardnadze said it took Gorbachev's government four years to determine that the station's location in Siberia violated the accord, as Western arms-control officials have long contended. He also denounced Moscow's nine-year involvement in the war in Afghanistan, saying it involved “gross violations of ... civil norms and ethics.”

Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered the ratings of some $145 million of Pinnacle debt because of “accelerating deficiency in liquidity,” which it said was evidenced by Pinnacle's elimination of dividend payments. Henry Sargent Jr., Pinnacle executive vice president, said the action “won't really have any effect on us.

MeraBank's rating for short-term deposits remains Not Prime. Securities of MeraBank were placed under review last May, and will remain under review for downgrade, the agency said.

3. Encouragement is fine; compulsion is not. Compelled service is unconstitutional. It is also unwise and unenforceable. (Who will throw several hundred thousand refusers in jail each year?) But through tax policy and in other ways the federal government encourages many kinds of behavior. It should also encourage service - preferably by all classes and all ages. Its encouragement should strengthen and not undercut the strong tradition of volunteering in the U.S., should build on the service programs already in existence, and should honor local convictions about which tasks most need doing.

His attorneys claim he was framed by the FBI and New York police as part of a campaign to destroy the black liberation movement of the 1960s.

The underlying bill approved yesterday is required to keep the government operating past midnight tonight, and this urgency has contributed to the speed - and, critics say, mistakes - that have accompanied the package of disaster assistance. The hastily drafted measure could hurt California by requiring it to put up more matching funds for emergency highway assistance than otherwise would be required. And the state's delegation is fearful that the new funding will be counted against a separate $185 million in federal highway funds it would expect to receive under its normal allocation this year.

The Big Three auto makers already have slashed fourth-quarter production plans 10.4% below year-ago levels, but that may not be enough to prevent inventories from ballooning if sales don't improve. Industry analyst John H. Qualls, a vice president with Hill & Knowlton in St. Louis, forecasts that domestic auto makers will have a 93-day supply of cars at the end of the year, even if car sales improve to a 6.5 million vehicle rate for the quarter. Ford Motor Co. reported a 21.2% drop in sales of domestic-made cars to 46,995 and a 24.2% drop in domestic trucks to 31,143. The sales are being dragged down by a glut of 1989 vehicles, said Joel Pitcoff, a Ford analyst. The earlier use of incentives depleted the market of “scavengers” for bargain-basement 1989 cars, he said.

In April 1987, the Senators,, absent Mr. Riegle, asked to meet with Ed Gray, then head of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, and according to Mr. Gray, unsuccessfully pressed him to drop a key regulation detrimental to Lincoln - “a clear subversion of the regulatory process.” Senator McCain now calls the meeting “improper” and after several previous denials, Senator Cranston now admits the regulation probably came up. Days later, the four senators - joined by Mr. Riegle - met with other regulators to press Lincoln's case.

Similarly, the spate of dubious prosecutions in finance obscures the seriousness of the allegations against Mr. Keating and his associates. This is not a matter of whispering “bunny.” The 160-page civil suit filed against Mr. Keating last month by the Resolution Trust Corp., the vehicle for the S&L bailout, traces a clear thread. Money was taken into Lincoln, for example by selling $250 million in uninsured debentures near retirement communities, and allegedly taken out of the parent company by insiders, for example by the sale of their personal stock to the company's employee stock ownership plan. The case remains to be tested in court, of course, but if the allegations hold up the Senators were defending a classic scam.

In a country where a bribe is needed to get a phone, a job, and even into a school, the name Bofors has become a potent rallying cry against the government. That illustrates the kind of disappointment many Indians feel toward Mr. Gandhi, whom they zestfully elected and enthusiastically supported in his first two years in power. His term has produced no spectacular failures in politics, in the economy or on the military front, and has chalked up some successes. But the average Indian had tremendous hope in the youthful leader and his promise to make both government and the ruling party more effective and less corrupt. His failures in those two areas deeply, and sometimes bitterly, disappointed many Indians.

For all the furor, there is nothing particularly complex about the concept of stock-index arbitrage, the most controversial type of computer-assisted program trading.

Defense intellectuals have complained for years that the Pentagon can not determine priorities because it has no strategy.

This city doesn't work that way.” With a five-year defense plan costing more than $1.6 trillion, it's about time we put together a defense strategy that works in Washington.

Reform starts in the Pentagon. Strategists should consider the impact of budget uncertainties at the beginning of the planning process. They ought to examine how a range of optimistic to pessimistic budget scenarios would change the defense program. They would then develop priorities by identifying the least painful program cuts as they moved from higher to lower budgets. They would also identify the best way to add programs, should the budget come in at higher levels. This kind of contingency analysis is common in war planning and business planning. There is no reason that it can not be done for defense planning.

Some casino owners have resisted the temptation to add rooms. Instead, they are spending to reinforce the identity that they believe attracts their customers. “More rooms aren't the answer for us,” says Caesars World chairman Henry Gluck. While his company's hotel is building a retail complex in Beverly Hills style and redoing existing rooms, it has decreased the number of its rooms. Some have been combined into suites for the high rollers.

At the University of Kentucky, a team led by Dean Currier, a physical therapy researcher, is testing the stimulators in conjunction with electric shocks to induce muscle contractions to help prevent wasting of thigh muscles after knee surgery. Similarly, a Purdue University team led by heart researcher W.A. Tacker hopes to develop ways to magnetically induce cardiac muscle contractions. The devices might someday serve as temporary pacemakers or restarters for stopped hearts, says Dr. Tacker, whose prototype was dubbed the “Tacker whacker.”

IRA rules have been changed over the years. One in 1981 raised to $2,000 a year from $1,500 the amount a person could put, tax-deductible, into the tax-deferred accounts and widened coverage to people under employer retirement plans. This caused an explosion of IRA promotions by brokers, banks, mutual funds and others. But in 1986 Congress sharply reduced the number of people who could qualify for its benefits and IRA tax-deductions slowed their roaring growth.

THE U.S. ECONOMY GREW at a moderate 2.5% annual rate in the third quarter despite the worst trade performance in six years. The expansion, matching the second quarter's pace, was fueled by strong consumer spending, especially for autos. But analysts expect GNP growth to slow in the current quarter. An inflation gauge slowed to a 2.9% growth rate from 5% the previous quarter.

In another sign of glasnost, Alexander Solzhenitsyn's long-banned chronicle of Soviet repression, “The Gulag Archipelago,” is now recommended reading in one 11th-grade Moscow history class .... British customs officers said they'd arrested eight men sneaking 111 rare snakes into Britain - including one man who strapped a pair of boa constrictors under his armpits. A customs official said the arrests followed a “Snake Day” at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, an event used by some collectors as an opportunity to obtain rare snakes.

The U.S.'s interest in Somalia consists of a single runway at the port of Berbera, which U.S. military aircraft have the right to use for surveillance of the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean. That strip of concrete is backed up by a few one-story, air-conditioned shacks where a handful of American nationals - buttressed by imported food, cold soft drinks and back issues of Sports Illustrated - maintain radio contact with the outside world. In the past two years, the desert behind them has become a land of mass executions and utter anarchy, where, due to Mr. Barre's brutality and ineptitude, nobody is any longer in control.

Mitsubishi Estate is one of the dozens of companies in today's Mitsubishi group. It's known for its cautiousness in part because it has had little need for bold overseas ventures: In the year ended March 31, 57.4% of its total revenue came from office building management. Its earnings can rise 10% to 12% annually simply from the natural turnover of tenants and automatic rent increases, says Graeme McDonald, an industry analyst at James Capel Pacific Ltd. For the latest fiscal year, the company's net income jumped a robust 19% to 35.5 billion yen ($250.2 million).

Small wonder that Britain's Labor Party wants credit controls. A few hours after the party launched its own affinity credit card earlier this month, the Tories raised the nation's base interest rate. Labor's Visa card is believed to be the first linked to a British political party. Labor gets 25 pence (39 cents) for every 100 (about $155) that a user charges to the card. As with other plastic in Britain's high-interest-rate environment, the Labor card, administered by Co-operative Bank, carries a stiff (in this case, 29.8%) annual rate on the unpaid balance.

Despite the thin trading, and after two painful years of restructuring, the futures market has shown itself to be resilient in two recent tests. While Asian markets struggled to cope with the uncertainty caused by the Oct. 13 plunge in New York stock prices, futures trading in Hong Kong was relatively heavy and went smoothly. That was also the case in the days following the June 4 massacre in Beijing, which caused a sharp drop in Hong Kong stock prices.

Other investors have lost millions in partnerships that bought thoroughbred racehorses or stallion breeding rights. One big problem has been the thoroughbred racehorse market. From 1974 to 1984, prices for the best yearlings at the summer sales rose 918% to an average of $544,681. Since then, prices have slumped, to an average of $395,374 this summer. But that's for the best horses, with most selling for much less - as little as $100 for some pedestrian thoroughbreds. Even while they move outside their traditional tony circle, racehorse owners still try to capitalize on the elan of the sport. Glossy brochures circulated at racetracks gush about the limelight of the winner's circle and high-society schmoozing. One handout promises: “Pedigrees, parties, post times, parimutuels and pageantry.”

Not everyone believes that the good times are over for shippers. “There's still a lot of pressure on rates in both rail and truck,” said Gerard McCullough, lecturer in transportation at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Less-than-truckload companies, which carry the freight of several shippers in each truck trailer, discounted away a 4.7% rate increase implemented last April. The carriers were competing fiercely for market share. Railroad-rate increases are likely to be restrained by weakening rail-traffic levels and keen competition for freight from trucks.

A recent example is the 3% consumption tax on all commercial activities. This makes enormous sense in Japan, where direct tax accounts for more than 70% of revenues and the capture rate of direct tax is so unfair. If you are a salaried man, Amen! 100% captured. If you are a retailer, 50%, and a farmer, 30%. To correct this inequality, most people would have favored an indirect tax, like the consumption tax. But the bill was passed without debate in the Diet, in the absence of the opposition. As a result, the Japanese people didn't know what to expect when the new law was introduced on April 1. They were frustrated by the longer queues at the cashier and the small coins given as change. All of a sudden, prices were no longer in denominations of 100 or 200. They were 103 or 206. Pockets exploded with one-yen coins.

Once such abuses become so pervasive, the IRS builds another factor into its secret computer formula for selecting returns for audit and doesn't need special projects for them. San Franciscans have a much higher incidence of audits than average because more of them score high under that formula, not because IRS agents envy their life styles.

So what Ms. Stevens talked about was the importance of saying the words at the front of the mouth with the lips and the teeth. She urged Ms. Pfeiffer to get the feeling of a smile in her throat and to put a smile on her face to give the pitch and the sound a lift. She kept harping on the importance of overdoing the consonants and percussive endings like “T” and “K.” She talked about using language as a tool, about flirting with the lyrics. And please, Michelle, when you sing the line in “Makin” Whoopee,” about another sunny, funny honeymoon, don't say “funn-ih,” the way Dylan would. Say “funn-eeee.” Put the clean vowel ending on it.

Still, there is money to be made. Most oil companies, when they set exploration and production budgets for this year, forecast revenue of $15 for each barrel of crude produced. Prices have averaged more than $2 a barrel higher than that - not a windfall, but at least a pleasant bonus for them. So, according to a Dun & Bradstreet Corp. survey, companies that had been refusing to spend even their very conservative budgets may loosen up before year end. It says 40% of those surveyed report that 1989 exploration spending will exceed 1988's.

“A strong art market is bringing out paintings I never expected to see on the market,” says David Nash, director of Sotheby's Fine Arts Division. Some museum directors never expected to see them there either. But since the 1986 tax laws drastically reduced deductions for the donation of appreciated property and reduced overall tax rates (thereby making deductions less significant), charitable donations to museums, when anyone makes them, are very charitable indeed. And given the seductive prices held out by the auction houses, the urge to sell can - and apparently has - become irresistible.

Many market makers in the S&P 100 index options contract had bullish positions Friday, and when the shutdown came they were frozen with huge losses. Over the weekend, clearing firms told the Chicago market makers to get out of their positions at any cost Monday morning.

Market makers buy what investors wish to sell; their business is reselling these unwanted positions as quickly as possible to other investors, and at a profit. As a result, while any one customer may purchase immediacy by selling to a market maker (which is micro-liquidity for the investor), the market as a whole remains in the same circumstances it was before the transaction: The unwanted position is still an unwanted position; only the identity of the seller has changed. In fact it can be argued that increasing capital commitments by market makers (a result of some post-1987 crash studies) also increases market volatility, since the more securities are held by market makers at any given time, the more selling pressure is overhanging the market.

Butch McCarty, who sells oil-field equipment for Davis Tool Co., is also busy. A native of the area, he is back now after riding the oil-field boom to the top, then surviving the bust running an Oklahoma City convenience store. “First year I came back there wasn't any work,” he says. “I think it's on the way back now. But it won't be a boom again. No major booms, no major setbacks,” he predicts. Business has been good enough that he just took a spur-of-the-moment weekend trip to the mountain area of Cloudcroft, something “I haven't done in years.”

The Bank of England, on the other hand, had gold reserves that averaged about 30% of its outstanding currency, and Bank of England notes were accepted throughout the world. The most likely reason for this disparity is that the Bank of England was a private bank with substantial earning assets, and the common-law rights of creditors to collect claims against the bank were well established in Britain. By contrast, in 19th-century Russia an authoritarian government owned the bank and had the power to revoke payment whenever it chose, much as it would in today's Soviet Union.

But the current Soviet purchasing spree may be a one-time affair. The goal of most U.S. firms - joint ventures - remains elusive.

Two bills in Congress hope to make such restrictions national. In May, Rep. Don Edwards (D. Calif.) introduced congressional legislation that would require an audible beeping during any employee monitoring, warning people that they are being heard. (The legislation is similar to a 1987 “beeper bill” that was defeated after heavy lobbying by the telemarketing industry.) Also last spring, Rep. Ron Dellums (D., Calif.), introduced a bill requiring universal two-party consent to any tapings in cases that don't involve law enforcement. In addition, products such as voice-activated tape recorders would have to include beep tones and labels explaining federal laws on eavesdropping.

Federal wiretap statutes recognize the right of employers to monitor employees' for evaluation purposes. And in the past, Congress has viewed monitoring as an issue best handled in union negotiations. But opponents, led by the CWA, say new laws are needed because monitoring is heavily concentrated in service industries and 81% of monitored workers aren't represented by unions. The CWA claims that monitoring not only infringes on employee privacy, but increases stress.

The new deal was considered the most generous of its kind, both financially and in terms of creative freedom. But it paled by comparison to what Sony was to offer last month: the chance, at last, to run a major studio, about $50 million in deferred compensation, up to 10% of Columbia's future cash flow, 8% of the future appreciation of Columbia's market value, and annual salaries of $2.7 million for each. The producers' 28% share of publicly held Guber Peters would net them an additional $50 million. Sony also agreed to indemnify the producers against any liability to Warner.

In novels of an earlier vintage, David would have represented excitement and danger; Malcolm, placid, middle-class security. The irony in this novel is that neither man represents a “safe” middle-class haven: Nora's decision is between emotional excitement and emotional security, with no firm economic base anywhere. The characters confront a world in which it seems increasingly difficult to find a “middle way” between the extremes of success and failure, wealth and poverty.

The reluctance of traders to buy contracts indicates that they have begun focusing on demand rather than supply.

But it doesn't take much to get burned. Political and currency gyrations can whipsaw the funds. Another concern: The funds' share prices tend to swing more than the broader market. When the stock market dropped nearly 7% Oct. 13, for instance, the Mexico Fund plunged about 18% and the Spain Fund fell 16%. And most country funds were clobbered more than most stocks after the 1987 crash.

Pemex's customers also are pleased with the company's new spirit. Grupo Desc, a big conglomerate, has long depended on Pemex petrochemicals to produce plastic packing material. But when the Pemex plant shut down for an annual overhaul, it would never give notice to its customers. “The capriciousness would completely disrupt our operations,” says Ernesto Vega Velasco, Desc's finance director. This year, for the first time, Desc and other customers were consulted well in advance of the Pemex plant's shutdown to ensure minimal inconvenience.

One bright sign is that a growing number of women have entered the once male-dominated field; more than a third of the ringers today are women. They aren't accepted everywhere, however. The oldest bell-ringing group in the country, the Ancient Society of College Youths, founded in 1637, remains male-only, a fact that's particularly galling to women because the group is the sole source of ringers for Britain's most prestigious churches, St. Paul's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey.

Three International Cash Portfolios funds, which invest almost exclusively in bonds and money-market instruments overseas, were among the four top-performing funds in the latest week. Because the funds' investments are denominated in foreign currencies, their value expressed in dollars goes up when those currencies rise against the dollar.

The most dramatic changes, however, probably will come in new-product development. Nearly 70% of cosmetics sales come through mass-distribution outlets such as drug stores and supermarkets, according to Andrew Shore, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. That figure has been inching up for several years. As the trend continues, demand for mass-market items that are high quality but only mid-priced - particularly skin-care products - is expected to increase. This fall, for example,L'Oreal Group, ordinarily a high-end line, rolled out a drug-store line of skin-care products called Plenitude, which retail for $5 to $15.

Federal credit programs date back to the New Deal, and were meant to break even financially. Since the 1950s, federal lending has experienced extraordinary growth in credit volume, subsidy rates, and policy applications, spurred on by the growth of government in general and budget gimmicks and deceptive management in particular. As we will see, many of these obligations don't show up as part of the federal deficit.

In this connection, it is important to note that several members of New York's sitting City Council represent heterogeneous districts that bring together sizable black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic white populations - Carolyn Maloney's 8th district in northern Manhattan and the south Bronx and Susan Alter's 25th district in Brooklyn, for example. To win their seats on the council, these political leaders have had to listen to all the voices in their district and devise public policies that would benefit all.

DEFERRED ANNUITIES: These insurance company contracts feature some of the same tax benefits and restrictions as non-deductible individual retirement accounts: Investment gains are compounded without tax consequences until money is withdrawn, but a 10% penalty tax is imposed on withdrawals made before age 59 1\/2. Aimed specifically at CD holders are so-called CD-type annuities, or certificates of annuity. An interest rate is guaranteed for between one and seven years, after which holders get 30 days to choose another guarantee period or to switch to another insurer's contract without the surrender charges that are common to annuities.

Wall Street is seething over the rules, which would curtail the tax deductibility of debt used in most LBOs.

Evidence of the growing Japanese demand for mortgage securities abounds.

If they finish today, the Sharpshooter can pump tomorrow. One roustabout, hanging by his hands from a ladder, bounces his weight on a three-foot wrench to loosen a stuck fitting. “We've been putting in long hours,” Mr. Ramirez says - six-day weeks and 13-hour days for the last two months. A year ago, when almost nothing was happening amid these desolate dunes, “you'd spend two days working and two days in the yard,” he recalls.

Yet Mr. McDuffie's career has developed at a slower pace than those of some of his better known contemporaries. During the late 1970s, he was part of a musical “brat pack” - a group of budding virtuosos who studied at the Juilliard School with the noted pedagogue Dorothy DeLay. His violin classmates included Shlomo Mintz, a protege of Isaac Stern who performed with major orchestras while still a student; Cho-Liang Lin, who joined the roster of ICM Artists Inc. at the age of 18; and Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg, who launched her career by winning the 1981 Naumberg Competition.

The compromise was a somewhat softened version of what the White House had said it would accept. Under the agreement with the House and Senate leaders, the minimum wage would rise from the current $3.35 an hour to $4.25 an hour by April 1991. Employers could also pay a subminimum “training wage” for 90 days to new workers who are up to 19 years old, and then for another 90 days if the company institutes a specific training program for the newcomers.

“Irish and Soviet people are similar,” says Mr. Ovcharenko. “They look the same. They're very friendly.” Moreover, he says, Irish companies are small but spunky. “We have to study their experience very well,” he says. “We must find any way to get business.” The two groups have been working together since the late 1970s, long before Soviet joint ventures were the rage in the West. Aeroflot carried about 125 million passengers last year, and Shannon Airport, the airline's largest transit airport outside the Soviet Union, saw 1,400 Aeroflot flights and 250,000 passengers pass through. An apartment complex down the road is the crew-rest and staging area for more than 130 Aeroflot pilots and flight attendants.

To more than replace the wood from two English oaks used for paneling at Paul Stuart, however, Mr. McDonough and friends planted 1,000 acorns around the country.

The Supreme Court and some states have specifically recognized that “the Fifth Amendment does not preclude the inference where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause.” Baxter v. Palmingiano, 425 U.S. 308 (1976). Thus, in a civil case, a defendant may be called as a witness, he may be forced to testify or take the Fifth, and his taking of the Fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter. He may take the Fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution. Allowing the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one's testimony harms him in the civil matter, but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution. Absent the risk of such prosecution, a court may order the defendant to testify.

Now, scholars in fulfilling their responsibility do not claim the right to invade every collection of papers that bears upon their topics of investigation.

But in the “Bare-Faced Messiah” case the author found most of his material in court records or via the Freedom of Information Act. And when responsible scholars gain legitimate access to unpublished materials, copyright should not be permitted to deny them use of quotations that help to establish historical points.

James Snedeker, senior vice president of Gill & Roeser Inc., a New York-based reinsurance broker, says insurers who took big losses this fall and had purchased little reinsurance in recent years will be asked to pay some pretty hefty rates if they want to buy reinsurance for 1990. However, companies with few catastrophe losses this year and already big buyers of reinsurance are likely to see their rates remain flat, or perhaps even decline slightly. Many companies will be negotiating their 1990 reinsurance contracts in the next few weeks.

Despite the pain of adjusting, the cultural revolution has begun to yield exciting cars. A year ago, the company completely revamped its near-luxury sedan, the $17,699 Maxima, which competes against a broad range of upscale sedans; it replaced its boxy, pug-nosed body with sleek, aerodynamic lines. Since then, Nissan also has launched new versions of the $13,249 240SX sporty coupe and 300ZX sports car. The restyled 300ZX costs as much as $33,000 and is squared off against the Porche 944, which begins at $41,900. Besides new styling, the new Nissans have more powerful engines and more sophisticated suspension systems. All three new models are outselling their predecessors by wide margins.

The $2.5 billion Byron 1 plant near Rockford, Ill., was completed in 1985. In a disputed 1985 ruling, the Commerce Commission said Commonwealth Edison could raise its electricity rates by $49 million to pay for the plant. But state courts upheld a challenge by consumer groups to the commission's rate increase and found the rates illegal. The Illinois Supreme Court ordered the commission to audit Commonwealth Edison's construction expenses and refund any unreasonable expenses. The utility has been collecting for the plant's construction cost from its 3.1 million customers subject to a refund since 1986.

But P&G contends the new Cheer is a unique formula that also offers an ingredient that prevents colors from fading. And retailers are expected to embrace the product, in part because it will take up less shelf space. “When shelf space was cheap, bigger was better,” says Hugh Zurkuhlen, an analyst at Salomon Bros. But with so many brands vying for space, that's no longer the case. If the new Cheer sells well, the trend toward smaller packaging is likely to accelerate as competitors follow with their own superconcentrates. Then retailers “will probably push the {less-established} brands out altogether,” he says.

Here, then, is where the Orange Workers have come to make apartheid's last stand. Their idea is to create a city, first, and then an entire nation - without blacks. This may seem to be a preposterous and utterly futile effort in Africa. And the fact that there are only 3,000 card-carrying Orange Workers may put them on the loony fringe. But their ideal of an Afrikaner homeland, an all-white reserve to be carved out of present-day South Africa, is a mainstream desire of the right-wing, which embraces about one-third of the country's five million whites. Afrikaner philosophers and theologians have long ruminated on the need for a white homeland. The Orange Workers are just putting this preaching into practice.

The fascist concept of corporatism envisaged an “organic” society in which citizens were spiritually and morally unified, and prepared to sacrifice themselves for the nation. This unification was to be brought about through policies and institutions that would unite workers and employers with government in a fully integrated and “harmonic” society. The key to the creation of the “organic” state lay in the formation of “natural” groups that would undertake the role of decision-making. By contrast, a parliamentary system based on abstract political rights and groups was held to cause, rather than resolve, conflict.

Despite their ubiquity, the consultants aren't entirely welcome. Some lawyers and scholars see the social scientists' vision of the American jury system as a far cry from the ideal presented in civics texts and memorialized on the movie screen. In the film classic “Twelve Angry Men,” the crucible of deliberations unmasks each juror's bias and purges it from playing a role in the verdict. After hours of conflict and debate, that jury focuses on the facts with near-perfect objectivity. In real life, jurors may not always work that way, but some court observers question why they shouldn't be encouraged to do so rather than be programmed not to.

He sold them well below market value to raise cash “to pay off mounting credit-card debts,” incurred to buy presents for his girlfriend, his attorney, Philip Russell, told IFAR. The curator, 27-year-old Sherman Krisher of Greenwich, Conn., had worked his way up from janitor in seven years at the museum.

Mr. Goldberg contends that even as “propaganda” the film fails because it presents only one view. Of course the Palestinians complain about their treatment; of course the Israelis feel put upon. But his complaint that “Days of Rage” doesn't contain balanced comments from Israelis about how badly the Palestinians are behaving is irrelevant. It's like doing a documentary on apartheid and insisting that equal time be given to how terrific white South Africans are. This film did emphasize how long the Israeli\/Palestinian stalemate has existed by tracing the conflict to the days of World War I when the British tried to guarantee both a Jewish state and a Palestinian state without specifying how it was to be done.

Another of Mr. Roberts's criticisms is that Bank lending has done more harm than good “by implanting the wrong incentives and deflecting energy away from economic development.” Here, too, Mr. Roberts is way off the mark. The reality is that Bank loans have been linked to policy improvements for 40 years. Our traditional project loans have, for instance, supported sensible energy pricing in the power sector, sound interest-rate policies in the credit area and the operation of public utilities as efficient, autonomous agencies. By and large, these efforts have borne fruit. In my home region, Latin America, much of the existing infrastructure base - an important building block for development - has been financed by the World Bank.

Some insurers have also started offering “persistency bonuses,” such as extra dividends or a marginally higher interest yield, if the policy is maintained for 10 years.

Import competition for U.S. furs has risen sharply since furriers started aggressively marketing “working-girl mink” and similar lower-priced imported furs in recent years. Merchants discovered a consumer largely ignored by higher-priced furriers: the younger woman - even in her late 20s - who never thought she could buy a mink. The new market helped boost U.S. fur sales to about $1.8 billion a year now, triple the level in the late 1970s. It also opened the door to furs made in South Korea, China, Hong Kong and other countries. Jindo Furs, a large South Korean maker, says it operates 35 retail outlets in the U.S. and plans to open 15 more by the end of next year. Mr. Purnick and other old-line furriers call many of the the imports unstylish and poorly made. High-end U.S. furriers say these imports haven't squeezed them. But low-priced and middle-priced furriers like Mr. Purnick, who once saturated the five-block Seventh Avenue fur district, say imports have cut their sales. A woman who once would have saved for two or three seasons to buy a U.S.-made mink can now get an imported mink right away for less than $2,000.

Corporate executives resent that their company's stock has been transformed into a nameless piece of a stock-index basket.

Oh, you're in the paper business,” is one reaction Mr. Sigler says he's gotten from his big institutional shareholders.

The forecasts were widely disseminated, and, in a splashy ad campaign launched in the summer of 1988, Merrill Lynch urged investors to buy bonds. It said long-term interest rates, then above 9%, could drop to 7% by the end of 1989, so bonds, which benefit from falling rates, would be a good buy. The firm also raised the percentage of bonds in its model portfolio from 40% to 45% and later to 55%.

The British conglomerate, planning its own defensive restructuring to fight off a # 13.35 billion ($21.03 billion) takeover bid by Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith, intends to press ahead with an extraordinary shareholder vote today to clear the way for its value-boosting measures. If anything, the gyrations in world stock markets - and in B.A.T's share price - since last Friday's sharp Wall Street sell-off have increased the likelihood of shareholder approval for the restructuring, analysts and several big institutional holders said. “Thank God we have some deal on the table,” said Stewart Gilchrist, a director at Scottish Amicable Investment Managers, which intends to vote its roughly 1% stake in favor of the restructuring.

In Robert Whiting's “You Gotta HaveWa” (Macmillan, 339 pages, $17.95), the Beatles give way to baseball, in the Nipponese version we would be hard put to call a “game.” As Mr. Whiting describes it, Nipponese baseball is a “mirror of Japan's fabled virtues of hard work and harmony.” “Wa” is Japanese for “team spirit” and Japanese ballplayers have miles and miles of it. A player's commitment to practice and team image is as important as his batting average. Polls once named Tokyo Giants star Tatsunori Hara, a “humble, uncomplaining, obedient soul,” as the male symbol of Japan.

THE FEDERAL COURT of appeals in Manhattan ruled that the dismissal of a 1980 indictment against former Bank of Crete owner George Koskotas should be reconsidered. The indictment, which was sealed and apparently forgotten by investigators until 1987, charges Mr. Koskotas and three others with tax fraud and other violations. He made numerous trips to the U.S. in the early 1980s, but wasn't arrested until 1987 when he showed up as a guest of then-Vice President George Bush at a government function. A federal judge in Manhattan threw out the indictment, finding that the seven-year delay violated the defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial. The appeals court, however, said the judge didn't adequately consider whether the delay would actually hurt the chances of a fair trial. Mr. Koskotas is fighting extradition proceedings that would return him to Greece, where he is charged with embezzling more than $250 million from the Bank of Crete. His attorney couldn't be reached for comment.

Indeed, the earthquake could contribute to a turnaround in the insurance cycle in a couple of ways. For example, insurers may seek to limit their future exposure to catastrophes by increasing the amount of reinsurance they buy. Such increased demand for reinsurance, along with the losses the reinsurers will bear from these two disasters, are likely to spur increases in reinsurance prices that will later be translated into an overall price rise. Reinsurance is protection taken out by the insurance firms themselves.

Medieval philosophers used to hold the sensible belief that it was more perfect to exist than not to exist, and that to exist as a matter of necessity was most perfect of all. Now, only God exists as a matter of absolute necessity; it is built into His nature. But since the time of Darwin, we humans could at least claim a sort of natural necessity for the existence of our species. Aren't we, after all, the inevitable culmination of that stately pageant called evolution? If mutation and natural selection slowly but surely give rise to more and more advanced forms of life, then it was only a matter of eons before splendid beings endowed with reason, self-awareness and taste shimmered onto the scene.

The truth is, Washington understands politics better than economics. Although the average citizen is probably not harmed too much from Washington's rhetorical war against Wall Street regarding excessive financial leveraging, actual legislation would probably impose considerable harm. Any such attempt to distinguish “good debt” from “bad debt,” or to draw the line at a particular industry, such as the airlines, is likely to blunt the spur that the proper amount of leverage provides both to equity markets and economic efficiency in general.

Why can't we teach our children to read, write and reckon? It's not that we don't know how to, because we do. It's that we don't want to. And the reason we don't want to is that effective education would require us to relinquish some cherished metaphysical beliefs about human nature in general and the human nature of young people in particular, as well as to violate some cherished vested interests. These beliefs so dominate our educational establishment, our media, our politicians, and even our parents that it seems almost blasphemous to challenge them.

That structural lack is crucial because investors are the only source of market liquidity. And liquidity is what markets need to damp quakes and aftershocks. In today's markets, specialists (on the New York Stock Exchange) and “upstairs” market makers (in the over-the-counter market) are the only market participants allowed to play a direct role in the price-determination process. When they halt trading, all market liquidity is gone. And when any component of the market - cash, futures or options - loses liquidity, the price discovery system (the way prices are determined) becomes flawed or is lost entirely for a time.

Such a statute illustrates the fundamental problem: Congress finds it is easier to pass sweepingly moralistic prohibitions, which the courts must thereafter interpret, than to engage in the difficult line-drawing distinctions that are inherently its responsibility. We are confronted less with a judicial power grab than with a legislative giveaway.

Young McDuffie's first violin teacher was Henrik Schwarzenberger, a Hungarian refugee who taught in the Macon public school system. “He taught me how to play like a gypsy,” jokes the musician. “I didn't learn to count until I got to Juilliard.” After studies at that conservatory's Pre-College Division with an assistant to the legendary instructor Ivan Galamian, he switched at the college level to Miss DeLay, Mr. Galamian's longtime assistant and, ultimately, his rival. “I think I had to prove myself to her,” says Mr. McDuffie. “But she was always encouraging. She only put her foot down twice,” he continues. “In my freshman year, my roommate was known as a party animal. She thought I wasn't getting my practicing done.” As the violinist tells it, his grandmotherly looking teacher “put her hands on her hips, stomped her foot and said, “You've just got to get the {expletive deleted} out of there.””

The reaction to the UAL debacle “is mindless,” says John Connolly, chief market strategist at Dean Witter. “UAL is a small deal as far as the overall market is concerned. The only way you can make it a big deal is to draw linkages that just don't make sense.” He suggests, for example, that investors may have assumed that just because UAL couldn't get financing, no leveraged buy-outs can get financing. Carried even further, some investors assumed that since leveraged buy-outs are the only thing propping up stock prices, the market would collapse if no more LBOs could be done.

The story of tumor-suppressor genes goes back to the 1970s, when a pediatrician named Alfred G. Knudson Jr. proposed that retinoblastoma stemmed from two separate genetic defects. He theorized that in the eye cancer, an infant inherited a damaged copy of a gene from one parent and a normal copy from the other. The tumor, he suggested, developed when the second, normal copy also was damaged. But there was no way to prove Dr. Knudson's “two-hit” theory.

Will the investments pay off? The growth of Las Vegas tourism in recent years persuades lenders that they will. Casino revenues and hotel occupancy rates are high. Last year, the tourists left $3 billion with the area's casinos, nearly 10% more than in 1987. The people with a stake in Nevada's gambling industry believe that they have barely tapped the potentially huge family trade.

Hilton currently is soliciting bids for a sale of part or all of its hotel and casino businesses. People familiar with Hilton said over the weekend that the depth of the sell-off in Hilton shares was unwarranted because none of the likely buyers would be dependent on junk-bond financing. However, they conceded that some potential bidders would rely on bank loans and would be hurt if the troubles of the UAL buy-out group signified a general unwillingness among banks to provide credit for debt-financed takeovers.

It's ironic that David Boren should be in the center of this mire. A former Oklahoma governor, he's a thoughtful defender of presidential powers in foreign policy. He's a rare Democratic hawk. He's the senator most like Arthur Vandenberg, the GOP senator from Michigan who worked to forge a bipartisan foreign policy in the 1940s. “Vandenberg and Rayburn are heroes of mine,” Mr. Boren says, referring as well to Sam Rayburn, the Democratic House speaker who cooperated with President Eisenhower. “They allowed this country to be credible. I really want to see that happen again.” If this were 1949, Mr. Boren might even succeed. But in 1989 most senators have other ideas. Last July, his committee rejected a Reagan administration plan to support a coup in Panama. Ohio Democrat Howard Metzenbaum refused to support any plan that might get people hurt, a charming notion for a great power. Maine Republican William Cohen said the plan might violate the assassination ban. So the administration dropped it. By October, when the committee rejected a much more modest covert proposal, even the administration was agreeing little should be done.

At least some economists, of course, would argue that inflation deserves a lot of emphasis. Earlier this month the St. Louis Fed held a conference to assess the system's first 75 years.

The inflation-growth argument is an old one, but Mr. Brady, on the board or off, is surely trying to influence Fed policy.

Amoco is the first major oil company to report third-quarter results. Analysts expect others to show a similar pattern. Generally in the quarter, overproduction of gasoline and higher crude oil prices pressured profitability. The industry's chemical profits also declined because excess capacity has depressed prices.

Analysts said the company's troubles mirror those of the industry. Retail advertising, which often represents half of the advertising volume at most daily newspapers, largely isn't rebounding in the second half from extended doldrums as expected.

Dow Jones & Co. recently reported net fell 9.9%, a reflection, in part, of continued softness in financial advertising at The Wall Street Journal and Barron's magazine.

We've heard California's property-tax-cutting Proposition 13 blamed for a lot over the years, but ABC's Ted Koppel came up with a new wrinkle in his earthquake coverage last week when he asked Democratic Assemblyman Richard Katz if Prop. 13 had withheld money needed for road maintenance. Mr. Katz happily agreed, sliding over the fact that California's roads and bridges aren't funded by property taxes but by state and federal gasoline taxes. Both have been raised at least 30% in recent years, even while the price of gasoline has fallen. Dragging Prop. 13 into this story is a pretty long stretch.

The president said that he and the Kremlin leader would meet Dec. 2-3 aboard U.S. and Soviet naval vessels in the Mediterranean to discuss a wide range of issues without a formal agenda.

Why is this happening? For one thing, quite a number of the leading spokesmen on Wall Street are not portfolio managers, who understand that the value of assets is greatly affected by how government taxes those assets. They are economists and financial reporters who sympathize with the view that a capital-gains tax cut benefits the rich. Yet they somehow think that Wall Street is indifferent to losing the tax cut that seemed so close Friday morning and is now problematic. The market rebound Monday followed weekend assurances from Mr. Darman that the administration has other plans to win the cut, which is alive and well.

California officials plan to ask Congress for $3 billion or more of federal aid, in the form of grants and low-interest loans.

Some of that money will be available for highway repair and special emergency aid, but members of the legislature are also mulling over a temporary state gasoline tax to raise money for earthquake relief.

a tragicomic monologue by an idealistic, not unheroic, though sadly self-deceived English butler in his sixties - proceeds as if the realistic English novel of manners, like Britannia herself, still ruled the waves. In fact, Kazuo Ishiguro's “The Remains of the Day” (Knopf, 245 pages, $18.95) is both an homage to traditional English forms and a dramatic critique of them. It implies that the British Empire was rooted in its subjects' minds, manners and morals, and argues, tacitly, that its self-destructive flaws were embodied in the defensive snobbery, willful blindness, role-playing and especially the locutions of its domestic servants.

- Students should move up the educational ladder as their academic potential allows. No student should be permitted to be graduated from elementary school without having mastered the 3 R's at the level that prevailed 20 years ago. This means “tracking,” whose main purpose is less to permit the gifted youngsters to flourish (though that is clearly desirable) than to ensure that the less gifted get the necessary grounding for further study or for entering the modern world of work. The notion that tracking is somehow “undemocratic” is absurd. The purpose of education is to encourage young men and women to realize their full academic potential. No one in his right mind actually believes that we all have an equal academic potential.

But Judge Leval felt constrained by an earlier decision of the Second Circuit Court forbidding a biographer of J.D. Salinger to quote from Mr. Salinger's personal letters. He distinguished the two cases: In Salinger, Judge Leval noted, the quotations were for the purpose of enlivening the biography rather than of proving points about the subject. Still the Salinger decision created a strong presumption against fair use of unpublished materials. Judge Leval reluctantly concluded that a few of Mr. Miller's quotations from Mr. Hubbard's unpublished writings, because they were not necessary to prove historical points, failed the fair-use test and therefore infringed copyright. But the proper remedy, Judge Leval said, lay in a suit for damages, not in an injunction.

These mainly involved such areas as materials - advanced soldering machines, for example - and medical developments derived from experimentation in space, such as artificial blood vessels.

Judging from the Americana in Haruki Murakami's “A Wild Sheep Chase” (Kodansha, 320 pages, $18.95), baby boomers on both sides of the Pacific have a lot in common. Although set in Japan, the novel's texture is almost entirely Western, especially American. Characters drink Salty Dogs, whistle “Johnny B. Goode” and watch Bugs Bunny reruns. They read Mickey Spillane and talk about Groucho and Harpo. They worry about their careers, drink too much and suffer through broken marriages and desultory affairs. This is Japan?

Several longtime observers of the commodities industry think the fortunes of the Merc over the next decade will be determined to a large extent by how well its new natural gas futures contract does and how successful its new president is in raising the level of compliance by floor traders with exchange and Commodity Futures Trading Commission rules. If the exchange falters in these moves, they say, it might once again fall behind its chief New York competitor, the Commodity Exchange. On Friday, the Merc's board announced that it had approved Sabine Pipe Line Co.'s Henry Hub in Erath, La., as the delivery site for its long-awaited natural gas futures contract. It also said that it would start trading the contract as soon as the CFTC approved it. The CFTC has 90 days to respond to such applications. The Merc first started working on developing this contract in 1984.

Until recently, such buy-now, pray-for-growth-later deals were routine. “But people don't buy anything on expectation anymore,” says Jack Utter, who manages the high-yield fund of IDS Financial Services. “Investors,” he adds, “are getting religion.” The TW buy-out may yet be financed. “There is nothing wrong with the company,” says Coniston principal Paul Tierney. The rub, he says, is that “the junk market isn't as deep” as before. TW's stockholder meeting was postponed from tomorrow to Nov. 21. By then, DLJ hopes to be able to sell less-junky junk bonds.

In it, traders buy or sell stocks and offset those positions in stock-index futures contracts to profit from fleeting price discrepancies.

Finally, even the time-honored strategy called “value investing” no longer means what it once did. Before the takeover mania of the '80s, it referred to rooting out through analysis undervalued stocks, especially those with shrewd management, sound fundamentals and decent prospects.

- FOREIGN TRADE. The current liberalization and decentralization of foreign trade would be taken much further. Soviet companies would face fewer obstacles for exports and could even invest their hard currency abroad. Foreigners would receive greater incentives to invest in the U.S.S.R. Alongside the current non-convertible ruble, a second currency would be introduced that could be freely exchanged for dollars and other Western currencies. A domestic foreign exchange market would be set up as part of an overhaul of the nation's banking system.

- Least-cost solutions. As conferees noted, scarce capital means the costs of control must be minimized through a broad menu of compliance choices for individual firms. That means simple, clear rules that secure the first large blocks of reduction, deferring more complex issues such as risk. It also means use of quantity-based pollution limits such as transferable permits, rather than price-based limits such as effluent fees. That's because quota-trained managers will likely respond better to quantity than to price signals.
