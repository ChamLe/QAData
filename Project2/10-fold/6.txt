So it's entirely possible that “Look Who's Talking” isn't as entertaining as it seems in comparison to the turgid other films opening now. But by comparison, this fluffy comedy seems like a gem. It starts with conception, taking the sperm's point of view, then progresses to the baby's point of view. Bruce Willis's best attribute as an actor is his coy, lazy voice, and that's all you get of him here, speaking for the baby.

Mr. Ishiguro's ability to create a fallible narrative voice that permits him to explore such intertwining domestic, cultural and political themes was abundantly clear in his previous novel, “An Artist of the Floating World,” set in Japan after the war. Now shifting his scene from the country he left at five to the England he has lived in for nearly 30 years, he has fashioned a novel in the mode of Henry James and E.M. Forster. With great aplomb he considers not only filial devotion and (utterly repressed) sexual love, but British anti-Semitism, the gentry's impatience with democracy and support of Hitler, and the moral problematics of loyalty: “It is, in practice, simply not possible to adopt such a critical attitude towards an employer and at the same time provide good service .... “This employer embodies all that I find noble and admirable. I will hereafter devote myself to serving him.” This is loyalty intelligently bestowed.”

Both Moody's and S&P cited First Boston's reliance in recent years on merchant banking, which has been responsible for a significant portion of the closely held firm's profit. The recent cash squeeze at Campeau Corp., First Boston's most lucrative client of the decade, is proving costly to First Boston because it arranged more than $3 billion of high-yield, high-risk junk financings for Campeau units. In addition, a big loan that First Boston made to Ohio Mattress Co. wasn't repaid on time when its $450 million junk financing for a buy-out of the bedding company was withdrawn.

TILT FUNDS: This is an index fund with a bet. Instead of replicating the S&P 500 or some other index exactly, some stocks are overweighted or underweighted in the portfolio. One simple approach is to exclude S&P 500 companies considered bankruptcy candidates; this can avoid weak sisters, but also can hurt when a company like Chrysler Corp. rebounds. Another approach: An investor with $100 million might use $75 million to buy the S&P 500 index and spend the other $25 million on a favorite group of stocks.

Mr. Pilson is an unlikely big spender.

Another solution, said a tax lawyer who requested anonymity, is for firms to use convertible bonds that sell at a discount. Since they have a lower interest rate, they wouldn't fall under the junk-bond category that would lose its deductibility. The House version of the bill would make debt non-deductible if it pays five percentage points above Treasury notes, has at least a five-year maturity and doesn't pay interest for at least one year out of the first five. The bill would then declare that the debt is equity and therefore isn't deductible. The Senate bill would only deny the deduction until interest is actually paid.

But the Americans are also to blame. They long made little effort here.

So far as we can see, there is no disagreement among Mr. Baker, Mr. Quayle, the Mr. Gates we've read, or for that matter President Bush.

Perhaps Mr. Gates would emphasize more than Mr. Baker the many hurdles the Soviet leader must leap if he is going to succeed. But everyone agrees that Mr. Gorbachev's problems result from the failure of his own system. They can be relieved only by changing that system, not by pouring Western money into it.

One proposal is to introduce a new payment system for parking in Paris. Instead of paying for parking by putting money in the existing machines, which deliver little paper receipts, drivers would be able to buy electronic cards in local tobacco shops. Once activated, the card would sit in the car's window, showing traffic wardens how much time the motorist could remain. When the motorist returned to his car he could turn the card off and, if it showed time remaining, save it for later. Seita is a partner in the project, which was developed by Matra SA using Japanese technology. Seita and Matra currently are negotiating with city officials for the right to begin service.

Goliaths like Unilever and P&G have enormous financial advantages over smaller rivals. Next year, Noxell plans to roll out a perfume called Navy, says George L. Bunting Jr., chairman of Noxell. Without P&G's backing, Noxell might not have been able to spend the estimated $5 million to $7 million needed to accomplish that without scrimping on its existing brands. Packaged-goods companies “will make it tougher for smaller people to remain competitive,” Mr. Bunting says.

No wonder. We were coming down straight into their canal. See, the other rule of thumb about ballooning is that you can't steer. And neither can your pilot. You can go only up or down (by heating the balloon's air with a propane burner, which does make the top of your head feel hot) and ride the air currents. Which makes the chase car necessary. Most balloonists seldom go higher than 2,000 feet and most average a leisurely 5-10 miles an hour. When the balloon is cruising along at a steady altitude there is little sense of motion. Only when one is ascending - or in our case descending a tad trop rapidement - does one feel, well, airborne in a picnic basket.

“The biotechnology firms may be setting up their own competitors,” said Richard Godown, president of the Industrial Biotechnology Association. He added that until now the Japanese have only acquired equity positions in U.S. biotechnology companies. “They are piggybacking onto developed technology,” he said. During the past five years, Japanese concerns have invested in several of the U.S.'s 431 independent biotechnology companies. Chugai has been one of the most active Japanese players in U.S. biotechnology companies; it has an equity investment in Genetics Institute Inc., Cambridge, Mass., and a joint-venture agreement with Upjohn Co., Kalamazoo, Mich.

These first magnitude wines ranged in price from $40 to $125 a bottle.

U.S. monetary policies ultimately will determine whether other nations are willing to accept American economic hegemony. Their challenges to that hegemony are probably a good thing. Because of America's international responsibilities, it is less free to engage in beggar-thy-neighbor tactics, through protectionism or attempts to manipulate currency relationships to its own advantage. The U.S. Congress and administration need frequent reminders of that responsibility. They also need reminders that if they shoulder the burden well, the U.S. can exercise enormous power on behalf of a sound world economy, with benefits to all.

The globalists tend to think Mr. Lawson ran onto technical reefs. In fixing rates the choice of initial parities is crucial, for example, and perhaps he picked the wrong pound-DM rate. For that matter, perhaps he fixed to the wrong currency. We sympathize with Mrs. Thatcher's reluctance to tie her currency to one governed by the domestic political imperatives of West Germany. Perhaps the shock would have been less if they'd fixed to another low-tax, deregulated, supply-side economy.

Conservatives have an important decision to make this fall.

From a reading of the somewhat scant English-language medical literature on RU-486, the French abortion pill emerges as one of the creepiest concoctions around. This is not only because it kills the unborn, a job at which it actually is not outstandingly efficient, zapping only 50% to 85% of them depending on which study you read (prostaglandin, taken in conjunction with the pill, boosts the rate to 95%). By contrast, surgical abortion is 99% effective.

Though it's clearly Max's wife who held sway here until her death, now none of the other male residents of this misbegotten household can challenge Max. The play concerns Teddy's homecoming with his wife of six years, Ruth. Curiously, Randall Arney as Teddy seems the only cast member unable to get beyond the zombie approach to a Pinter character. As Ruth, Moira Harris, a large and beautiful woman who may be our next Colleen Dewhurst, begins almost immediately to overpower each of the men. In the end, Teddy returns alone to America, leaving Ruth in Max's chair. We have seen her develop within a few hours from a shy and unknown in-law to a goddess of the flesh who will replace the dead mother, and then some.

The only thing Robert Goldberg could praise about CBS's new show “Island Son” (Leisure & Arts, Sept. 25) was the local color; unfortunately neither he nor the producers of the show have done their homework. For instance: “Haole” (white) is not the ultimate insult; “Mainland haole” is. Richard Chamberlain dresses as a “Mainland haole,” tucking in a Hawaiian shirt and rolling up its long sleeves. And the local expression for brother is “brah,” not “bruddah.” And even if a nurse would wear flowers in her hair while on duty, if she were engaged she would know to wear them behind her left, not right, ear. Sorry, the show does not even have the one redeeming quality of genuine local color.

SUGAR: Futures prices declined. The March contract was off 0.32 cent a pound at 13.97 cents. At one point in early trading the March price rose to as high as 14.22 cents when the stock market recovered, but the price then fell back. A price-depressing factor, one analyst said, was that India, which had been expected to buy around 200,000 tons of sugar in the world market, didn't make any purchases. India recently bought 200,000 tons and was expected to buy more, the analyst said. Another analyst thought that India may have pulled back because of the concern over the stock market. “India may have felt that if there was a severe drop in the stock market and it affected sugar, it could buy at lower prices,” said Judith Ganes, analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton, New York. At any rate, she added, “India needs the sugar, so it will be in sooner or later to buy it.”

Friday's 44-cent-a-barrel price drop to $19.98 in the expiring November contract for West Texas Intermediate crude may well set the tone for trading this week in petroleum futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Most traders and analysts attributed the decline to technical factors associated with the contract's going off the board. Others said that the drop continued the downward correction that's been due in the petroleum pits and that such a trend could well continue in the next several trading sessions. Barring any petroleum-related news events, trading in the days ahead should further test recent projections by oil economists and other market watchers that strong fourth-quarter demand will keep prices firm.

And Beijing has pulled back on domestic loans and subsidies, leaving many domestic buyers and export-oriented plants strapped for cash.

Right now, the largest loan the FHA can insure in high-cost housing markets is $101,250. Last week, housing lobbies persuaded Congress to raise the ceiling to $124,875, making FHA loans more accessible to the well-to-do. But it does that at the cost of deepening the taxpayer's exposure if the FHA is forced to pay for more loans going sour. This is no idle fear last year the FHA lost $4.2 billion in loan defaults.

But it is Mr. Lane, as movie director, producer and writer, who has been obsessed with refitting Chaplin's Little Tramp in a contemporary way. In 1976, as a film student at the Purchase campus of the State University of New York, Mr. Lane shot “A Place in Time,” a 36-minute black-and-white film about a sketch artist, a man of the streets. Now, 13 years later, Mr. Lane has revived his Artist in a full-length movie called “Sidewalk Stories,” a poignant piece of work about a modern-day tramp. Of course, if the film contained dialogue, Mr. Lane's Artist would be called a homeless person. So would the Little Tramp, for that matter.

Many Americans still agonize over their own personal feelings about abortion. Mr. Bush's problem isn't so much that he seems to be agonizing over the issue as it is that he seems to vacillate on it. The political risk would be far less if the president drew a firm line and hewed to it, experts insist. “If you have a position, you're better off to stick with it than to move around very much,” says Republican strategist John Sears. The need for consistency is especially acute for Mr. Bush, who, Mr. Sears maintains, lacks a strong ideological base.

One group is the Committee on State Taxation, which comprises 330 multistate corporations and advises the Council of State Chambers of Commerce.

The claim that inflation generates economic growth is seductive. In fact it does the opposite. As the charts show, the 1975-80 inflation destroyed both productivity and economic growth (see accompanying charts - WSJ Oct. 17, 1989). It was only after Mr. Volcker killed inflation, at the cost of a sharp but brief recession, that growth and productivity started rising once more. Producers were forced by the discipline of sound money to slash away organizational fat and acquire more efficient equipment. After having performed that admirable feat, however, they were back in 1985 demanding a dollar devaluation that would make it still easier for them to compete in international markets. They got the devaluation and, as is usually the case, began picking up fat again. So now they want another one.

The BMC folks aren't really amateurs at intellectual dueling. President Jeffrey Bell in 1978 upset longtime New Jersey Republican Senator Clifford Case in a primary and made an unsuccessful run at Bill Bradley's U.S. Senate seat.

Jack Kemp, sharpening his political skills and providing analysis to back up the congressman's supply-side arguments. So even though BMC is only 18 months old, its principals have been part of the national economic debate for years.

While many commentators, particularly French ones, worry that hasty and emotional reaction to the changes in the East might lead to dangerous pressures for a denuclearized Europe or the speeded-up withdrawal of American troops, Mr. Roper in London sees a more positive scenario. “There seems to be a message from Moscow there's a deal on offer,” he says. “They want reassurance we won't try to undermine or destroy the Warsaw Pact ....

District Court Judge Pierre Leval denied the injunction on the ground that New Era had failed to make its claim within a reasonable time - the doctrine lawyers call “laches.” As for the merits, Judge Leval said that Mr. Miller had written “a serious book of responsible historical criticism.” Verbatim quotation, the judge believed, was justified in order to prove points the author had asserted about Mr. Hubbard - mendacity, bigotry, paranoia and other unlovely traits that could not be persuasively demonstrated without use of Mr. Hubbard's own words. “The biographer\/critic,” Judge Leval wrote, “should not be required simply to express ... conclusions without defending them by example.” In such circumstances, free-speech interests outweighed the interests of the copyright owner.

El Salvador is destroying more than 1.6 million pounds of food that had rotted in government warehouses, government officials said. The state Supply Regulator Institute is to burn rice, corn and beans that spoiled because of neglect and corruption in the previous Christian Democrat government, a statement from the information service SISAL said. During the past administration the foodstuffs were first bought by the institute, then sold at low prices to “unscrupulous businessmen” who resold them to the institute at inflated prices, the statement said.

All of this talk is antithetical to the Tax Reform Act of 1986. In exchange for dramatically lower tax rates, the framers of that legislation sought to eliminate most of the exemptions, deductions and credits that gave some taxpayers an advantage over others. The goal was to tax people with roughly equivalent incomes equally, and to eliminate the many shelters that allowed the wealthy to escape taxes.

The recent bids for United and American Airlines have led Congress to move with supersonic speed to protect incumbent airline managements. The House is scheduled to vote today on an anti-airline-takeover bill that would block, for up to 50 days, any bid for 15% or more of a U.S. airline, even a straight cash purchase. Transportation Secretary Sam Skinner, who earlier fueled the anti-takeover fires with his quasi-xenophobic attacks on foreign investment in U.S. carriers, now says the bill would further disturb the jittery capital markets. Texas Rep. Steve Bartlett, who has 40,000 American Airlines workers in his district, says the bill is “good politics, but bad law.” It is ironic that at a time when America's partial airline deregulation is being emulated by governments from New Zealand to Ethiopia, so many in Congress favor an incumbent-protection program for airlines that would be more appropriate for the Soviet airline, Aeroflot.

But Justice Brennan foresaw his new role, strongly defending the importance of dissents in a 1985 speech. “Each time the court revisits an issue, the justices will be forced by a dissent to reconsider the fundamental questions and to rethink the result,” he said.

So far, Mr. Greenspan's cautious approach to policy has served both him and the nation well. His hand on the monetary tiller seems one reason why the economy next month seems highly likely to begin an unprecedented eighth year of peacetime growth without a recession. “We've gotten through two stock market crashes, and we've gone through an election without any major problems,” says David Hale, an economist of Kemper Financial Services. “I think you have to give Greenspan a good rating.”

The White House used television appearances and leaks to argue that congressionally imposed restrictions on covert actions made U.S. support for such coups difficult. Mr. Bush even disclosed privately that one Reagan-era deal with Congress required him to notify the odious Panamanian dictator, Manuel Noriega, if the U.S. learned of a coup plot that might endanger his life. The president also hinted he might veto this year's intelligence authorization bill if it is too restrictive.

Eventually we came to rest in a soggy patch of field where we had the exquisite pleasure of scrambling out of the basket into the mud while the French half of our ballooning tag team scrambled in. I looked at my watch. Barely half-an-hour aloft. Back in the chase car, we drove around some more, got stuck in a ditch, enlisted the aid of a local farmer to get out the trailer hitch and pull us out of the ditch. We finally rendezvoused with our balloon, which had come to rest on a dirt road amid a clutch of Epinalers who watched us disassemble our craft - another half-an-hour of non-flight activity - that included the precision routine of yanking the balloon to the ground, punching all the air out of it, rolling it up and cramming it and the basket into the trailer. It was the most exercise we'd had all morning and it was followed by our driving immediately to the nearest watering hole.

The mild inflation figures renewed investors' hopes that the Federal Reserve will ease its interest-rate stance. The steep climb in producer prices reported last Friday fostered pessimism about lower interest rates and contributed to the stock market's 6.9% plunge that day. In the past several days, however, the U.S.'s central bank has allowed a key interest rate to fall slightly to try to stabilize the markets. Analysts say Fed policy makers have been wary of relaxing credit too much because they were still uncertain about the level of inflation in the economy.

The main argument for growth stocks is their usually superior performance in a slowing economy. “If the market refocuses on earnings, we should get better valuations of growth stocks,” says L.

Mercantilists argue that a weak currency is a good thing because it makes a nation's products more competitive. But that cherished notion may have influenced Mr. Lawson to peg the pound too low, causing Britain to import all of Europe's inflationary pressures. A weak currency creates bargains for foreign buyers, sometimes pushing demand beyond a nation's productive capacity and forcing prices upward. Criticisms of the U.S. Treasury for agreeing to participate in an international effort to drive down the dollar last month are based on that danger.

As a money manager and a grass-roots environmentalist, I was very disappointed to read in the premiere issue of Garbage that The Wall Street Journal uses 220,000 metric tons of newsprint each year, but that only 1.4% of it comes from recycled paper. By contrast, the Los Angeles Times, for example, uses 83% recycled paper. With newspapers being the largest single component of solid waste in our landfills, and with our country overflowing with trash, all sectors of our society and all types of businesses must become more responsible in our use and disposal of precious natural resources.

Another factor that has been dominating the thinking of many stock analysts is the current plight of the junk-bond market. Although UAL, the second-largest leveraged buy-out ever, was to have been financed with bank debt instead of junk bonds, its failure to obtain financing focused attention on the entire market for leveraged deals, underscoring just how dependent the entire market has become on junk bonds. Many stocks owe at least part of their market valuation to the perception that they could soon be the subject of a takeover or buy-out. Attention is focused on the so-called breakup value of the stock in the hands of an imagined acquirer who would buy the company at a big premium, perhaps planning to sell it piece by piece.

Mr. Dole's odd effort notwithstanding, most of Turkey's political problems lie with the Europeans. Part of the problem some Europeans have with Turkey seems to stem from its location - Turkey isn't really part of Europe. Why, they wonder, should it belong to the EC? Another anti-Turkish hook is the Islamic faith of the majority of the Turkish people: Turkey, we are told, is not a Christian nation; its people simply won't fit in with the Western European Judeo-Christian tradition. It's when these rationalizations fall on deaf ears that the old standby of retribution for treatment at the hands of the Ottoman Empire comes to the fore.

So if index arbitrage is simply taking advantage of thin inefficiencies between two markets for the same widget, how did “program trading” evolve into the evil creature that is evoking the curses of so many observers? All arguments against program trading, even those pressed without fact, conclude with three expected results after “reforms” are implemented: 1) reduced volatility, 2) a long-term investment focus, and 3) a level playing field for the small investor. But many of these reforms are unneeded, even harmful.

New Jersey Wastewater Treatment Trust - $75.1 million, two-part offering of bonds apparently was won by a Merrill Lynch Capital Markets group. The group's bid for $40.9 million of wastewater treatment insured bonds, Series 1989 A, produced a 7.0826% true interest cost. The Series 1989 A bonds are insured and rated triple-A by Moody's and S&P. The group's bid for $34.2 million of wastewater treatment bonds, Series 1989 B, produced a 7.0808% true interest cost. The Series 1989 B bonds are uninsured and rated double-A by Moody's and S&P. Both the Series 1989 A and Series 1989 B bonds were priced to yield from 6% in 1991 to 7.15% in 2008-2009, according to a Merrill Lynch official.

During his years in Chiriqui, however, Mr. Noriega also revealed himself as an officer as perverse as he was ingenious.

Mr. Noriega would order them all to take off their clothes and run around the courtyard naked, laughing at them and then retreating to his office. “People started wondering if something was wrong with him,” Mr. Miranda recalls.

It's hardly astonishing (given the men's track record) that Sony wants Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters. But it is puzzling to some Hollywood executives that Sony rushed to hire them without clearing up the Warner situation first. Some note that Sony might have saved itself some trouble by just hiring Mr. Guber and letting Mr. Peters stay on to fulfill the Warner contract. But though “people in town may ask why Guber needs Peters, it's good to have a partner, and obviously the chemistry works,” says Steven Tisch, a producer who once worked for Mr. Guber. “This business isn't about personalities at the end of the day - it s about whether the ink is red or black.

As it happened, the collection survived intact. Today, the Leningrad State Museum of Theater and Music owns some 400,000 items. For Americans, the most interesting of the 400 items on display in New York include designs by the German-born Andrei Roller (1805-91) for the Russian productions of important early 19th-century Paris ballets. No less illuminating are the designs from Petipa's “Sleeping Beauty” (1890), “Nutcracker” (1892) and “Raymonda” (1897), which shed light on the role played by spectacle in the ballets of this great choreographer. There also is much to be learned from the early stage photographs of Petipa's work, which, though posed, extend our knowledge of its theatrical ambiance.

Potential candidates may be discouraged from running less by the congressional salary than by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a Democratic opponent. To the extent that potential Republican candidates and their financial backers realize that the congressional prisoner's dilemma game works to their disadvantage, the Republican Party will be hindered in its attempts to field a competitive slate of congressional candidates.

Sentencing was postponed on Aug. 18, when Mr. Krisher was hospitalized for depression. His efforts to get back the stolen strips had resulted in recovery of just three. But on Oct. 6, he had reason to celebrate. Two days earlier, his attorney met in a Park Avenue law office with a cartoon dealer who expected to sell 44 of the most important stolen strips to Mr. Russell for $62,800. Instead, New York City police seized the stolen goods, and Mr. Krisher avoided jail. He was sentenced to 500 hours of community service and restitution to the museum of $45,000.

4. Make your due-process system visible. It won't do any good for anybody unless employees know about it. Most managements hesitate to go all out in advertising their due-process systems for fear of encouraging cranks and chronic soreheads to file complaints. On the other hand, they make sure at a minimum that their systems are described in their employee handbooks and talked up by personnel specialists. Smith-Kline Beecham goes further and sometimes features its grievance procedure in closed-circuit TV programs.

The number of misclassified workers may be in the millions, mostly paid by small firms. Many workers, especially professionals, want to remain independent to avoid tax withholding and to continue to deduct many expenses that employees can't. But many others, who want to qualify for employee benefits and unemployment compensation, become tipsters for the IRS, says Jerry Lackey, who manages the IRS project's force of nine agents in north and central Florida from Orlando. Firms that are paying employment taxes also provide leads to competitors that aren't, he says.

Views on manufacturing strength are split between economists who read September's low level of factory job growth as a sign of a slowdown and those who use the somewhat more comforting total employment figures in their calculations.

Copper prices fell sharply Friday afternoon. For example, copper for December delivery settled 4.5 cents lower at $1.2345 a pound.

Gorky was a loyal if occasionally ambivalent proletarian writer committed to enlightening the masses with plain speaking rooted in a slightly sour version of Chekhovian humanism.

The FAA argues that requiring safety seats for all babies might actually diminish, not enhance, safety. As part of such a rule, officials say, parents would probably be required to buy an extra ticket for the baby. The increased cost of flying would inevitably encourage some families to drive rather than fly, they say. Commercial airlines have the lowest accident rate of all transportation modes - much lower than cars, for example.

The scientists then took the five toxin genes and triggered a mutation in the one gene that caused virulence. Then, using a new technique (called homologous recombination) for introducing genes into cells, they transferred all five genes to bacteria closely related to the pertussis organism.

Jim Beam print ads, however, strike different chords in different countries. In Australia, land of the outback, a snapshot of Jim Beam lies on a strip of hand-tooled leather. West Germans get glitz, with bourbon in the foreground and a posh Beverly Hills hotel in the background. Ads for England are artsy and irreverent. One ad features a huge robot carrying a voluptuous woman in a faint. The tagline: “I only asked if she wanted a Jim Beam.”

Then at 10:15 the Dow suddenly started to rebound, and when it shot upward it did so even faster than the early-morning fall. And this time, it wasn't just the program traders who were responsible.

But according to one trader, the programmers “didn't look as dominant on the upside as on the downside because there was {also} a lot of bargain-hunting” by institutions.

Mr. Louis-Dreyfus, formerly chief executive of the pharmaceutical research firm IMS International Inc., has a reputation as a savvy financial manager, and will be charged largely with repairing Saatchi's poor financial state.

A third problem was the potential for labor unrest at UAL, something that makes the Japanese particularly skittish. The Japanese banks were reminded of the labor tensions at UAL all last week.

On Thursday, at their national convention in Las Vegas, machinists union leaders discussed launching an allout campaign against UAL Chairman Wolf specifically. The machinists have opposed the buy-out because they weren't invited to participate in the deal and because they fear all the debt that would be taken on in the transaction would overburden the company.

Admirers of Mr. Glass may agree with the critic Richard Kostelanetz's sense that the 1974 “Music in Twelve Parts” is as encyclopedic and weighty as “The Well-Tempered Clavier.” But while making the obvious point that both composers develop variations from themes, this comparison ignores the intensely claustrophobic nature of Mr. Glass's music. Its supposedly austere minimalism overlays a bombast that makes one yearn for the astringency of neoclassical Stravinsky, the genuinely radical minimalism of Berg and Webern, and what in retrospect even seems like concision in Mahler.

Companies will continue to war over standards.

That explains why the number of these wines is expanding so rapidly. But consumers who buy at this level are also more knowledgeable than they were a few years ago. “They won't buy if the quality is not there,” said Cedric Martin of Martin Wine Cellar in New Orleans. “Or if they feel the wine is overpriced and they can get something equally good for less.” Mr. Martin has increased prices on some wines (like Grgich Hills Chardonnay, now $32) just to slow down movement, but he is beginning to see some resistance to high-priced red Burgundies and Cabernets and Chardonnays in the $30 to $40 range.

She highlighted exclusionary business practices that the U.S. government has identified. But her main thrust was to promote the importance of world-wide free trade and open competition. She said the trade imbalance was mainly due to macroeconomic factors and shouldn't be tackled by setting quantitative targets.

One of the most remarkable features of the forced marches of the ethnic Turks out of Bulgaria over the past five months has been the lack of international attention. The deportation of more than 315,000 men, women and children by the Bulgarian regime adds up to one of the largest migrations seen in the postwar years. Yet some people are advancing a chilling casuistry: that what we are seeing is somehow the understandable result of the historical sins committed by the Turks in the 16th century. Today's Turks in Bulgaria, in other words, deserve what is coming to them four centuries later.

When the bikes first entered mass production in 1981, they were dismissed as a fad. Last year, 25% of the 10 million bicycles sold in the U.S. were mountain bikes. In California, a bellwether market, they accounted for more than 80% of all bike sales. The majority of the bikes never even make it into the high country. City dwellers love them because they shift smoothly in traffic, bounce easily over curbs and roll through road glass with far fewer flat tires than racing bikes.

The short-term shift in the political climate surrounding abortion reflects two factors that are likely to govern the debate in the next several months: the reawakening of the abortion-rights movement as a potent force after years of lassitude, and the ability of each side to counter the other's advance in one arena with a victory of its own elsewhere.

I will be the first to agree that there is much to be found wrong with modern movie making. Many modern scriptwriters seem to be incapable of writing drama, or anything else, without foul-mouthed cursing. Sex and violence are routinely included even when they are irrelevant to the script, and high-tech special effects are continually substituted for good plot and character development. In short, we have a movie and television industry that is either incapable or petrified of making a movie unless it carries a PG-13 or R rating. Hence copious amounts of gratuitous sex, violence and gutter language are included as a crutch. However, these faults are not the exclusive property of modern comedies, and I believe Mr. Knight errs when he attempts to link this modern phenomenon too closely to a single category of movie making.

Such fervor for cycling helped Mr. Sinyard build a creative company at the forefront of its industry. Founded by bike enthusiasts rather than businessmen, Specialized spotted the appeal of fat-tired bikes that go almost anywhere and began mass-producing them in 1981. In the past five years, the company's sales have grown to $80 million from $26 million. Today, so-called mountain bikes account for two-thirds of the $2 billion spent annually on all bicycles in the U.S. With 65% of its sales coming from mountain bikes, Specialized is widely considered to be a market leader. (Accessories, largely for mountain-bike users, account for much of the rest of sales.)

A line-item veto is a procedure that would allow a president to veto part of a big congressional spending bill without having to scuttle the entire measure.

Adults with AIDS have had access to AZT since the FDA approved the drug's usage for adults in March 1987.

GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Prices closed lower after trading in relatively narrow ranges because of strong selling in the cash market and continued favorable harvest weather. The sale to the Chinese government of 330,000 metric tons of wheat under the government's export enhancement program was announced after the close of trading Monday, but the sale was expected and failed to buoy prices yesterday, said Dale Gustafson, a futures analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago. As for other export customers, the Soviet Union isn't expected to be back buying U.S. corn in significant amounts until early next year, he said. A number of commercial grain users buttressed that opinion yesterday by buying certain corn options for delivery in March, indicating to analysts that the commercial companies would use the options to hedge against expected corn sales in next year's first quarter.

Traders are especially sensitive to reports of possible U.S. soybean sales because U.S. exports are lagging.

The Philanthropic Advisory Service of the BBB reviews hundreds of new charities every year, measuring them against minimum standards for accountability; for accuracy and honesty in solicitation; and for percentage of funds actually going to work for which the charity was supposedly established. The Service figures at least half of the money taken in should be spent on program. Roughly a third of the charities reviewed flunk the test.

Japanese lenders also recently have grown more conservative toward highly leveraged transactions, partly because of the recent cash-squeeze at Canada's Campeau Corp. following its leveraged purchase of Federated Department Stores Inc. last year. Japanese banks are worried that the government might issue restrictive guidelines unless the banks hold down the number of risky leveraged-buy-out loans they make, says a Japanese monetary official. “So, they are very cautious,” he says.

Mr. Monieson's defense at the CFTC hearing will partly be that he is a busy man and wasn't personally involved in GNP's retail brokerage business. During his years as Merc chairman, 1983 through 1985, Mr. Monieson played host to prime ministers and crown princes; his attorneys have prepared charts showing the many Merc meetings he attended and the time he spent away on business.

There can be no quibbling that the Armenians endured terrible suffering, but one has to wonder what possible good such a resolution will achieve. It puts great strain on a longstanding U.S. friendship with Turkey, a country that has been one of America's strongest allies in NATO. The resolution also comes at a time when Turkey has been seeking help from the United States in resolving its Bulgarian emigration controversy and pursuing democratic reforms that may lead to membership in the European Community.

Like all genes, tumor-suppressor genes are inherited in two copies, one from each parent.

Concerning your Sept. 19 article “Wall Street Firms Link Analysts' Pay to Performance,” I'm delighted that Wall Street is finally tuning in to the hard, cold facts of the real working world. If the firms are serious, however, why limit the practice to the poor, maligned analysts whose ability to see into the future is fragile at best? Why not extend the same harsh standards to the sales force, and pay brokers a base salary with annual bonus based on how much money they made for their clients during the year? That should stop a lot of account-churning, and produce a stock market driven only by professional concern, careful thought and good sense. Now, wouldn't that be a novelty.

Further, I think Mr. Knight made a poor choice in picking “A Fish Called Wanda” as an example of the deplorable state of modern comedy movies.

There is no slow-motion close-up, blood-and-guts portrayal of the animal's demise.

In recent weeks, warm and dry weather has sped the Midwest harvest and that is permitting farmers to rebuild the stockpiles that were cut by the 1988 drought. If the weather allowed farmers to work in their fields over the weekend, many Midwest grain elevators will probably sell futures contracts today at the Chicago Board of Trade in order to hedge their weekend purchases from farmers. That selling of futures contracts by elevators is what helps keep downward pressure on crop prices during the harvest.

A revolution takes more than conference manifestos. Indeed, skepticism was amply captured by a joke told by Poles at the conference: “The world must be coming to an end. The Russians are talking peace. The Palestinians are talking elections.

Along with reduced volume, analysts said the nation's fifth largest steelmaker was hurt by holding higher-cost inventory when raw material costs of such key products as nickel dropped. Operating profit dropped 46% in its specialty flat-rolled steel segment. Moreover, the company said higher sales and shipments to service centers from its Armco Steel Co. joint venture failed to offset weakness in the automotive market, higher production costs and a poorer product mix.

PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices inched upward in mostly lackluster trading. December gold was up $3.20 an ounce at $373.40; December silver gained 5.7 cents to $5.1950 an ounce. January platinum rose $2.30 an ounce to $488.60. Mr. Kaiser said there were no fundamental factors moving these markets. He noted that two weeks ago there were rumors of Soviet sales of precious metals to finance grain purchases, but the sales don't seem to have materialized. Ms. Raptopoulos thought yesterday's price action reflected weakness in the stock market and the dollar. “Gold still acts as a haven when uncertainty prevails in the financial markets as it did” yesterday, she said. Mr. Kaiser noted that gold was more than 71 times the price of silver at the close yesterday, which is historically high. “The high ratio reflects the fact that silver is still regarded as about a half-industrial metal and its price lagging relative to gold says that traders are expecting a weakening economy,” he said.

But if it was the national disease in 1906, it is today the national commonplace. If there is no law against it, do it. If the law leaves loopholes, use them. If there is no moral prohibition that expressly forbids it, full speed ahead. And if you are caught or if people complain, simply argue that “everyone does it” or “no one said I shouldn't” and brazen it out. As a last recourse, when all else has failed and you are pinned, apologize for having disappointed those who trusted you but deny having actually done anything wrong. (See, for instance, Jim Bakker's remarks upon being sentenced to prison this Tuesday for defrauding the faithful.) Consider the troubling dissonance between Mr. Shevardnadze's speech of confession this week and the hang-tough defense of everyone concerned with the Iran-Contra affair. The Soviet foreign minister publicly concedes that his government “violated norms of behavior” in Afghanistan and just plain lied about the radar station. We have people in high place still lying through their teeth about Iran-Contra, and that apparently isn't going to change. For that matter, those long ago identified as liars are still given respectful hearings in the press.

The presence of Unilever and P&G is likely to increase the impact of advertising on cosmetics. While the two are among the world's biggest advertisers, most makers of upscale cosmetics spend relatively little on national ads. Instead, they focus on events in department stores and pour their promotional budgets into gifts that go along with purchases. Estee Lauder, for example, spends only an estimated 5% of sales on advertising in the U.S., and Mr. Lauder says he has no plans to change his strategy.

Mr. Darman's inclination to save the sequester was backed up yesterday by White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater: “There is some feeling here that the cuts are the way to go. It will reduce spending in a very effective fashion.” This attitude is being waved away by sophisticates around Washington as little more than tough talk. It looks to us like a golden opportunity for George Bush to chop off at the knees all this talk about a timid, unserious presidency. Mr. Bush would be acting in the public interest if he let the Washington elites who manipulate these budgets - the bureaucrats, the lobbyists, the congressional staffers - live for just one year on a restricted diet. Ask Tommy Lasorda; thin is in. Senator Phil Gramm pointed out Monday that in the 20 years before Gramm-Rudman was enacted in 1985, federal spending grew by about 11% a year; since the law, it's grown at under 5% annually. Another major factor in this positive trend was Ronald Reagan's decision early in his presidency to fight the budget war on the expenditure side rather than raising taxes.

Although the economy showed no change of pace from the second quarter, many analysts expect it to slow considerably in the fourth quarter as demand for autos falls, partly because of higher prices on models introduced last month. Many economists think the rise in the value of the U.S. dollar this year will further crimp progress in trade, because it makes exports more expensive and imports cheaper. And business investment - which slowed in the third quarter, according to yesterday's report - is expected to continue to be sluggish.

This won't happen until strategists come down from their ivory tower and learn to work in the real world of limited budgets and uncertain futures. As it is, we identify national goals and the threats to these goals, we shape a strategy to counter these threats, we determine the forces needed to execute the strategy, before finally forging the budgets needed to build and maintain the forces. These procedures consume millions of man-hours of labor and produce tons of paper, and each year, their end product - the Five Year Defense Plan - promptly melts away.

But as advertisers latch onto disasters with increasing frequency, they risk hurting themselves as much as helping the cause. They chance alienating the customers they hope to woo by looking like opportunistic sharks. “People see extra messages in advertising, and if a manufacturer is clearly trying to get something out of it ... if it's too transparent ... then consumers will see through that,” warns John Philip Jones, chairman of the advertising department at the Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University.

About 160 workers at a factory that made paper for the Kent filters were exposed to asbestos in the 1950s. Areas of the factory were particularly dusty where the crocidolite was used. Workers dumped large burlap sacks of the imported material into a huge bin, poured in cotton and acetate fibers and mechanically mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters. Workers described “clouds of blue dust” that hung over parts of the factory, even though exhaust fans ventilated the area.

Mr. Stein said Woodstream is “marginally profitable” but hasn't performed as well as expected. Woodstream's Victor-brand mousetraps and other pest-control products are “doing very well,” and its plastic storage-case products “are poised for growth,” he said. But the unit's third segment, wildlife traps, is suffering from a “depressed market,” and Ekco is seeking to sell that segment, he said. Mr. Stein said he expects profit to be higher in 1990 than in 1989, reflecting a number of measures taken since the acquisition of Ekco Housewares in late 1987. (Prior to acquiring the housewares business, the company was known as Centronics Corp.; Centronics had been a maker of computer printers, but Mr. Stein and other officers decided to sell that business after Japanese competitors grabbed a dominant share of the market.)

Though modest, the change reaches beyond the oil patch, too.

Petipa, the fountainhead of balletic classicism, emerges as the show's hero, whether perceived through scenes from his ballets or through glimpses of the dancers whose technique and artistry his choreography played a decisive role in shaping. Among the most important of the Petipa ballerinas is Mathilde Kchessinska, represented in a series of fascinating photographs. The mistress of Nicholas II until his engagement to Alexandra of Hesse-Darmstadt, she dominated the Imperial Ballet of St. Petersburg as much through her dancing as through her connections. Even Isadora Duncan, the self-professed enemy of ballet, found her enchanting. A 1910 photograph shows Kchessinska reclining on a chaise longue in her St. Petersburg mansion. Clearly visible in the background is the balcony from which Lenin was to proclaim the Revolution.

ENERGY: Worried that Friday's 190-point stock market plunge might be a harbinger of things to come for the economy, petroleum futures traders called a halt to the recent string of increases in crude oil futures prices. The U.S. benchmark crude, West Texas Intermediate, closed at $20.59 a barrel for November delivery, down 30 cents. Some analysts said crude was due for a correction anyhow, following several days of significant gains. But most market observers agreed that Friday's stock market drop is what dampened spirits in the petroleum pits yesterday. Until yesterday, futures prices had been headed up on expectations that world oil demand will continue to be strong. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries increased its production ceiling for the fourth quarter based on projections of robust demand. So any bearish indicator, such as Friday's precipitous drop in the stock market, sends shivers through the oil markets as well. Indeed, after reacting early in the trading day to Friday's plummet, futures prices firmed up again as traders took note of the stock market's partial recovery yesterday.

Gen. Scowcroft doesn't plan to increase the staff right now, but is weighing that possibility, the official adds.

Mrs. Yeargin's case also casts some light on the dark side of school reform, where pressures on teachers are growing and where high-stakes testing has enhanced the temptation to cheat. The 1987 statute Mrs. Yeargin violated was designed to enforce provisions of South Carolina's school-improvement laws. Prosecutors alleged that she was trying to bolster students' scores to win a bonus under the state's 1984 Education Improvement Act. The bonus depended on her ability to produce higher student-test scores.

From the way she sang in those early sessions, it seemed clear that Michelle had been listening not to Ella but to Bob Dylan. “There was a pronunciation and approach that seemed Dylan-influenced,” recalled Ms. Stevens. Vowels were swallowed, word endings were given short or no shrift. “When we worked it almost became a joke with us that I was constantly reminding her to say the consonants as well as the vowels.” To explain exactly what she meant, Ms. Stevens and Mr. Grusin went into a Los Angeles studio and recorded a vocal\/piano demo of the songs being considered for inclusion in the movie so that Ms. Pfeiffer could learn the numbers, correct enunciation and all.

That's about all it costs to appease Adm. Erich Raeder's ghost. In 1941, Raeder and the German navy threatened to attack the Panama Canal, so we created the Southern Command in Panama. The Southern Command has grown even bigger since the war because Raeder's ghost sometimes runs through the E ring dressed like Gen. Noriega. The Command's huge bureaucracy is needed to analyze whether leaders of coups against Gen. Noriega meet the War Powers Act's six points, Cap Weinberger's seven points, the Intelligence Committee's 32 points and Woodrow Wilson's 14 points necessary to justify U.S. support.

The new contract also eliminates the $15 monthly coupon, good only at union-owned grocery stores, that was part of the salary of every worker, from roughneck to chief executive. About 9,800 technical workers, notably chemists and lawyers, were switched to non-union status. Also, because of its reduced capital budget, Pemex has phased out about 50,000 transitory construction workers, reducing the work force to about 140,000, the union leader says. Mr. Guzman Cabrera says the union's sacrifices will be offset by a wage and benefit package that amounts to a 22% increase in compensation.

They are based on dubious psychological and sociological theories rather than on educational experience.

About 8,000 National Union of Mineworkers members resumed their strike against De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. after further negotiations to settle a wage dispute broke down. Striking workers, who began striking five diamond mines on Oct. 13, had returned to work last week when the union and De Beers arranged to reopen negotiations. A De Beers spokesman said yesterday the company had offered to increase the minimum wage by 18%, while the union was demanding 26.6%. Before the two parties resumed talks last week, De Beers offered 17% and the union wanted 37.6%.

Where non-violent civil disobedience is the centerpiece, rather than a lawful demonstration that may only attract crime, it is difficult to justify. Some find no harm in the misdemeanors of trespass, minor property destruction, blocking traffic and the like.

The Universal-Morning News deal also troubles syndicated writers and artists, who fear that they won't get their cut from this new type of exclusivity payment. (Creators of syndicated features generally receive about half the fee a newspaper pays for their work.) Mr. McMeel says some of the exclusivity payment fee will be used for future development of features and promises that those whose work appears in the Morning News will see “substantial immediate increases” in pay. But he concedes that they haven't been notified yet. The uncertainty already has some in the business plotting new strategy. Arnold Schwartzman, a Dayton, Ohio, lawyer who has represented about 50 writers and artists, says that any new contract or renewal he negotiates will require that special payments be shared with his clients.

An additional benefit is the creation of jobs. This starts in the construction phase through the use of minority contractors and local workers. It continues through the life of the center; the Vermont-Slauson Center has created 500 permanent private-sector jobs at a one-time cost in public funds of only $2,500 per job. As many of these jobs are filled by local residents, who move from the welfare rolls to the tax rolls, the $2,500-per-job public investment should repay itself in a few years. And that is before consideration of increased state and local revenues from taxes and fees on sales, real estate, licenses and the like.

Out of concern for the potentially damaging effects of this proposal, and still awaiting the GAO report on FHA losses, I suggested the Senate instead work on ways to eliminate or substantially curtail this vast loan-guarantee expansion. After several hours of floor debate and three roll-call votes, we reached a compromise, placing the FHA loan-guarantee ceiling at $124,875. Although my desire to retain the present ceiling was exceeded by $23,625, a firm limit on loan guarantees did provide some consolation in the face of allowing a haphazard floating cap to remain in the bill.

Sony found a new market niche, but Mr. Kaye figured that its prices left plenty of room for a lower-priced competitor. His products aren't exact copies of Sony's but strongly resemble them in size, shape and, especially, color. Sony uses mostly red and blue, with traces of yellow - and so does Justin, on the theory that kids prefer these colors. (“To be successful, a product can be any color whatsoever, as long as it is fire-engine red,” says Charles E. Baxley, Justin's attorney.)

These statesmen might take counsel from William Robinson, author of “The English Flower Garden” - the gardener's bible since 1883 - who seems to have had a Jennifer Bartlett in mind when he wrote: “Unhappily, our gardeners for ages have suffered at the hands of the decorative artist when applying his “designs” to the garden .... It is this adapting of absurd “knots' and patterns from old books to any surface where a flower garden has to be made that leads to bad and frivolous design - wrong in plan and hopeless for the life of plants.”

Sara Albert, a 34-year-old Dallas law student, says she's generally skittish about the stock market and the takeover activity that seems to fuel it. “I have this feeling that it's built on sand,” she says, that the market rises “but there's no foundation to it.” She and her husband pulled most of their investments out of the market after the 1987 crash, although she still owns some Texaco stock. Partly because of concern about the economy and partly because she recently quit her job as a legal assistant to go to school, “I think at this point we want to be a lot more liquid.”

Eastern and its creditors agreed in July on a reorganization plan that called for the carrier to sell off $1.8 billion in assets and to emerge from Chapter 11 status in late 1989 at two-thirds its former size.

Mr. Roberts also takes a swipe at the Bank's adjustment lending. What are the facts on this type of lending? The Bank has been making adjustment loans for 10 years. As their name implies, these operations are linked to far-reaching policy reforms that aim at helping borrowing countries get back on the growth path and at enhancing their credit-worthiness. Typically, these measures include reforms to downsize the role of government and parastatals in the economy, to open up inward-looking economies to international competition and to promote the development of a vigorous private sector.

Though Mr. Colton says expanding FHA lending would result in “no cost to the government,” the mere diversion of funds from other parts of the economy and from other forms of housing (such as low-income) to the single-family home market would result in a major expense. More important, housing programs run by HUD, the VA, and FmHA are awash in red ink. The FHA alone lost $4.2 billion in fiscal 1988; the government's equity in the agency, essentially its reserve fund, fell to minus $2.9 billion. The federal government has had to pump in $2.28 billion into the VA housing program since 1984 to keep the fund afloat and the VA requested an additional $120 million for the fiscal year just ended. All told, the federal government already guarantees more than $900 billion of mortgages.

What real-estate strategy should one follow in a metropolitan area whose economic health is not as easy to determine as Houston's or Denver's? Generally, overcapacity in commercial real estate is dropping from its mid-1980s peak, even in such economically healthy metropolitan areas as Washington, New York and Los Angeles. Vacancy rates in the 15% to 19% range today may easily rise to the low to mid-20% range in a couple of years. Under these conditions, even a flattening out of economic growth - “catching cold” - in the healthy metropolitan areas will create significant opportunities for corporations and professional service firms looking for bargains as the realestate industry catches pneumonia.

There's a certain irony in the fact that Federal Express faces its first union problems as a result of its Tiger purchase. Tiger itself was founded by a band of gungho airmen who had airlifted supplies “over the Hump” from India to China during World War II. In the early 1970s, Mr. Smith modeled his fledgling company on Tiger's innovation of hub-and-spoke and containerized-cargo operations. But from early on, Tiger's workers unionized, while Federal's never have.

The work force provides the third arm of the “alliance.” Within the alliance it is supposed to act as a balancing force, guarding against excessive control by government or abuse of its economic position by business, for either could result in a deterioration of its living standards (under the new resolutions, workers councils may demand that a cooperative be closed or its prices be reduced). By providing workers with the opportunity to move into the private sector where wages tend to be higher, and by holding out the promise of more consumer goods, Mr. Gorbachev hopes to revive the popularity of the party.

Now, GM appears to be stepping up the pace of its factory consolidation to get in shape for the 1990s. One reason is mounting competition from new Japanese car plants in the U.S. that are pouring out more than one million vehicles a year at costs lower than GM can match. Another is that United Auto Workers union officials have signaled they want tighter no-layoff provisions in the new Big Three national contract that will be negotiated next year. GM officials want to get their strategy to reduce capacity and the work force in place before those talks begin.

What triggered the latest clash was a skirmish over the timing of a New Zealand government bond issue. Nomura was attempting to organize the 50 billion-yen ($352 million) borrowing in Japan at a time when many Japanese banks, led by Industrial Bank of Japan, were pressuring the Wellington government to help them recover loans made to a defunct investment bank that had been owned by New Zealand's civil-service pension fund. Unwilling to put up new money for New Zealand until those debts are repaid, most banks refused even to play administrative roles in the new financing, forcing an embarrassed Nomura to postpone it this week.

Though growers can't always keep the worm from the apple, they can protect themselves against the price vagaries of any one variety by diversifying - into the recently imported Gala, a sweet New Zealand native; the Esopus Spitzenburg, reportedly Thomas Jefferson's favorite apple; disease-resistant kinds like the Liberty. “I've ripped out a lot of Delicious” and grafted the trees with many different shoots, says Steve Wood, a West Lebanon, N.H., grower, tramping through his 100-acre Poverty Lane Orchard on a crisp autumn day recently. “I've got 70 kinds of apples. Here's a Waltana,” he exclaims, picking one off a tree. He bites it, scowls and throws it down. “It's a real dog.”

In addition, under the highway-relief program, the federal government provides 100% of emergency highway aid for only the first 90 days of a repair effort. After that, the federal share diminishes. For interstate highways, the federal share normally would drop to 90% of the cost of repairs, and the state would have to pick up the remainder of the cost.

A second theme is the undercurrent of social class and race in the public reaction to the Morgan case. Dr. Morgan is a highly educated white professional who attended some of the “best” schools. As members of the Black Caucus in Congress asked during the debate on the legislation that freed Dr. Morgan, does anyone seriously believe that if she were an uneducated, black, working-class woman, Congress would have rushed to pass a private relief bill freeing her? Or that the president would have hurried to sign the bill “out of compassion for her plight”? To ask those questions is to answer them.

If these assumptions hold, voters in races for Congress face what in economic theory is called a prisoner's dilemma and have an incentive, at the margin, to lean Democratic.

“The era of the 1980s is about compound interest and the reaching for it,” says James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, an early critic of the junk bond market. “What we've begun to see is the damage to businesses of paying exorbitant compound interest. Businesses were borrowing at interest rates higher than their own earnings. What we're seeing now is the wrenching readjustment of asset values to a future when speculative-grade debt will be hard to obtain rather than easy.”

Discussing the recent slide in stock prices, the central bank governor stated that “the markets now appear to have steadied” after the “nasty jolt” of the 190.58-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average a week ago.

More recently, Guber Peters beat out a dozen other producers, reportedly including Robert Redford and Ted Turner, for rights to the life story of Chico Mendes, the murdered Brazilian union leader who fought developers in the Amazon rain forest. Messrs. Guber and Peters assiduously courted the man's widow for months, showing her a tape of “Gorillas in the Mist” to impress her with the quality of their work. Money helped, too. Ultimately, they paid more than $1 million for the rights. (The sale caused a rift between the widow and some of her husband's followers. Some of the money will go to the Chico Mendes Foundation, but it isn't earmarked for groups trying to save the rain forest.)

But while IRS computers focus routinely on target groups like these, the agency has assigned many agents to special projects that need more personal attention. In most cases, the IRS says, these projects are local or regional, rather than national, and arise because auditors in an area detect some pattern of abuse among, say, factory workers claiming that having a multitude of dependents frees them from tax withholding or yacht owners deducting losses from sideline charter businesses.

But there's a catch. Sidhpur and adjacent districts are the only places in the world where psyllium is grown in large quantities. This is partly due to the particular demands of the crop.

But the government didn't step in until six months ago, when thrift officials put Lincoln into conservatorship - the day after American Continental filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors. The bankruptcy filing, the government has charged in a $1.1 billion civil lawsuit, was part of a pattern to shift insured deposits to the parent company, which used the deposits as a cache for real-estate deals. The deposits that have been transferred to other subsidiaries are now under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court. “I think it's fairly clear {Mr. Keating} knew,” that regulators were set to seize Lincoln, Mr. Seidman said.

The scoff, coming from the man many consider Mrs. Thatcher's most influential adviser, sparked considerable worry. It not only conflicted with Mr. Lawson's views but ran counter to the position Mrs. Thatcher took at the EC summit in Madrid last June. There, she said that Britain would join the EMS once the EC had completely liberalized restrictions on capital movements and exchange controls, and once Britain's inflation rate had fallen into line with the rest of the EC.

It must be able to handle most of the complaints that can not be solved in the trenches by managers and their subordinates, else the company court or adjudicators will be inundated with cases.

At TWA, the System Board of Adjustment hears 50 to 75 cases a year, only a fraction of the complaints brought to personnel specialists. At Citicorp, the Problem Review Board may hear only 12 or so cases because of personnel's skill in complaint-resolution.

An incident in 1984 suggested one additional means by which Mr. Noriega might have maintained such influence with Washington - by compromising U.S. officials. Curtin Windsor, then the ambassador to Costa Rica, recalls being invited to Panama by Mr. Noriega's brother Luis Carlos for a weekend of deep sea fishing and “quiet, serious conversation” on the Aswara Peninsula. Mr. Windsor notified Everett E. Briggs, the U.S. ambassador to Panama, of the invitation. “Briggs screamed,” Mr. Windsor recalls. He says Mr. Briggs told him he was being set up for a “honey trap,” in which Mr. Noriega would try to involve him in an orgy and then record the event “with sound and video.” Mr. Briggs, on vacation after resigning his position at the National Security Council, couldn't be reached for comment.

Pay raises of 60% over the past three years have given many South Koreans the money to enjoy the things they were supplying the rest of the world. The success of newcomer SsangYong Motor shows the strength of the auto market and its growing diversity. A part of the construction-oriented conglomerate SsangYong Group, it took over the dying Dong-A Motor Co. in 1986. SsangYong began making variations of the Jeep-like “Korando” vehicle. (Dong-A had had a technology agreement with Jeep maker American Motors Corp., now a part of Chrysler Corp.) The most popular style is the stretched “Family,” which resembles a Ford Bronco or Chevy Blazer. The four-wheel-drive vehicles start at $15,000; a Family can cost over $25,000.

Again and again, program-trading's critics raise the “casino” theme.

The $20,000 tax would be a small cost in a multibillion-dollar deal, but a serious drag on thousands of small, friendly deals. One especially dangerous aspect to the new tax would be that the proceeds will be used to increase the budgets of the antitrust division at Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. This amounts to a bounty for regulators - the more regulating the more they get to keep. Also, as former Reagan antitrust chief Charles Rule has noted, this would “establish the precedent that the government may charge parties for the privilege of being sued regardless of whether the government prevails.”

The Washington, D.C., think tank recommends that the courts adopt different “tracks” for different types of civil cases in order to separate the handling of highly complex suits from simpler ones. Complex cases, such as antitrust suits and many business disputes, would receive intense supervision by federal judges to keep pretrial proceedings moving.

PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices eased as increased stability and strength came into the securities markets. December delivery gold fell $3.20 an ounce to $377.60. December silver declined 6.50 cents an ounce to $5.2180. January platinum was down $5.70 an ounce at $494.50. Precious metals, gold in particular, currently are being influenced more by stock market gyrations than the dollar as traders seek greater investment stability, according to WilliamO'Neill, vice president of research at Elders Futures in New York. “The recent rally in precious metals was a result of uncertainty and volatility in equities,” he said. Yesterday, the stock market rose strongly, creating a more defensive attitude among precious metals traders, he said. Silver and platinum, which have more of an industrial nature than gold, were even weaker, he said. Silver is also under pressure of “extremely high” inventories in warehouses of the Commodity Exchange, he said. Yesterday, these stocks rose by 170,262 ounces to a record of 226,570,380 ounces, according to an exchange spokesman.

Overall, PC sales in Japan in the first half of 1989 were 34% higher than in the year-earlier period. Combined PC and work-station use in Japan will jump as much as 25% annually over the next five years, according to some analysts, compared with about 10% in the U.S. And with a labor shortage and intense competitive pressure to improve efficiency, more and more Japanese companies are concluding that they have no choice. “We have too many people in our home offices,” says Yoshio Hatakeyama, the president of the Japan Management Association. “Productivity in Japanese offices is relatively low.”

The removal of Mr. Honecker was apparently the result of bitter infighting within the top ranks of the Communist party. According to West German government sources, Mr. Honecker and several senior Politburo members fought over the last week to delay any decisions about a leadership change.

Those allies included Politburo members Guenter Mittag, who has long headed economic affairs, and Joachim Hermann, chief of information policy. Both men were also relieved of their duties yesterday.

Against the rapid cosmetic overhaul of the Socialist Party the LDP has been paralyzed. Now is the time to reform the government from a provider, developing-country vanguard role to that of a modern, industrialized nation in which consumers have the ultimate choice. If the LDP, as currently composed, can't make the transformation, then it should split into two parties. One party could stand for consumer interests, small government, free trade and globalism to put Japan clearly among the most developed and open countries. The other party could continue on the traditional track of the LDP, representing the manufacturers' preference for larger government, control, regulation and protectionism.

The adjustments result from the recently passed thrift-industry bailout legislation, which requires thrifts to divest all high-yield bond investments by 1994. Previously, Columbia didn't have to adjust the book value of its junk-bond holdings to reflect declines in market prices, because it held the bonds as long-term investments.

The Packwood plan also would include a proposal, designed by Sen. William Roth (R., Del.), that would create new tax benefits for individual retirement accounts. The Roth plan would create a new, non-deductible IRA from which money could be withdrawn tax-free not only for retirement, but also for the purchase of a first home, education expenses and medical expenses. Current IRAs could be rolled over into the new IRAs, but would be subject to tax though no penalty.
