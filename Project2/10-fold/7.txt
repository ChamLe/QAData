In response to your extracts from David Fenton's memo (“How a PR Firm Executed the Alar Scare,” editorial page, Oct. 3): For the past 10 years, the Environmental Protection Agency has known about the carcinogenic hazards of Alar, and has carried on proceedings to remove the chemical from the market.

The old guard had every right, however, to disdain the newcomers' new ways of making money, such as greenmail. (A Fortune article on Saul Steinberg was entitled, “Fear and Loathing in the Corporate Boardrooms.”) Their other staple has been corporate takeovers, often hostile and financed by junk bonds. Hostile takeovers are quite a new phenomenon. Sometimes they are constructive, but often not. First, by making management focus on short-term results, they inhibit building for the future - just the opposite of Japan. Second, a long-term shareholder of a good company needn't worry too much when the stock price drops temporarily: It will bounce back. But if a raider takes over when the stock is weak, the shareholder never gets his recovery.

Last week the British displayed unusual political immaturity. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson, resigned because Prime Minister Thatcher would not fire her trusted adviser Sir Alan Walters. The opposition Labor Party leader, Neil Kinnock, in a display of the male chauvinism typical of the British lower class, denounced Mrs. Thatcher for having an independent mind and refusing to heed the men in her Cabinet. The British press, making a mountain out of a molehill, precipitated an unnecessary economic crisis by portraying Mrs. Thatcher as an autocrat who had thrown economic policy into confusion by driving a respected figure from her government.

This has been a week of stunning events behind what was once called the Iron Curtain and interesting shifts in official American policy toward Moscow. It has also been a week when inside-the-beltway Washington has had a high old time gnawing over ex-President Reagan's multimillion-dollar junket in Japan. The latter may seem oddly irrelevant, if not downright trivial, given the big picture and the way we have handled it in the nation's capital has done nothing to dispel that impression. In fact, however, Mr. Reagan's casual debasement of the office he so recently held raises issues about which Americans can actually do something. Our ability to influence the outcome of events in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union is far more marginal.

Analysts noted that the disappointing results don't reflect lower prices for steel products. Charles Bradford, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, said higher prices for galvanized and cold-rolled products offset lower prices for bar, hot-rolled and structural steel. Structural steel, which primarily serves the construction market, was especially hurt by a 15% price drop, Mr. Bradford said.

The RTC had previously targeted five thrifts for quick sales in order to spend cash by certain budgetary deadlines, but the delays illustrate the tough chore facing the agency. “These thrifts are beached whales,” said Bert Ely, an industry consultant based in Alexandria, Va. For example, the delay in selling People's Heritage Savings, Salina, Kan., with $1.7 billion in assets, has forced the RTC to consider selling off the thrift branch-by-branch, instead of as a whole institution.

Finally, there is one family movie that quite eloquently explores the depth of human emotion - only its stars are bears. For the second time, in a movie called “The Bear,” French director Jean-Jacques Annaud demonstrates just how powerful pictures can be. (“Quest for Fire” was the first time.) To be sure, one wonders what kind of man is this, who feels compelled to try to understand the most primitive longing and instinct in a way that requires the most sophisticated appreciation of visual storytelling. Supposedly, he proposed the movie to his producer, Claude Berri, in four lines: “An orphan bear cub. A big solitary bear. Two hunters in the forest. The animals' point of view.”

The Fed's stock market role ought not to be very ambitious. It should seek only to maintain the functioning of markets - not to prop up the Dow Jones or New York Stock Exchange averages at a particular level. The Fed should guard against systemic risk, but not against the risks inherent in individual stocks. It would be inappropriate for the government or the central bank to buy or sell IBM or General Motors shares. Instead, the Fed could buy the broad market composites in the futures market. The increased demand would normalize trading and stabilize prices. Stabilizing the derivative markets would tend to stabilize the primary market. The Fed would eliminate the cause of the potential panic rather than attempting to treat the symptom - the liquidity of the banks.

Although the proposal, authored by Mr. Packwood and Sen. William Roth (R., Del.), appears to have general backing by Republicans, their votes aren't sufficient to pass it. And Democrats, who are under increasing pressure from their leaders to reject the gains-tax cut, are finding reasons to say no, at least for now. A major reason is that they believe the Packwood-Roth plan would lose buckets of revenue over the long run.

The Fed's efforts at secrecy were partly foiled Sunday morning, when both the New York Times and the Washington Post carried stories quoting a senior Fed official saying the central bank was prepared to pour cash into the banking system Monday morning. Fed Chairman Greenspan was surprised by both stories, according to knowledgeable sources, and insisted he hadn't authorized any public comment. Nevertheless, Fed officials acknowledged the stories were reasonably accurate portrayals of the central bank's game plan. It is prepared to assume the same role it played in October 1987, providing money to the markets if necessary to keep the financial system afloat. The Fed provides money to the banking system by buying government securities from financial institutions.

Most of the mailers are free, but Denver-based Financial Programs sells, for $15, a version customized to the age of the child and the college of choice. The figures are shocking.

Back then, scientists had no way of ferreting out specific genes, but under a microscope they could see the 23 pairs of chromosomes in the cells that contain the genes. Occasionally, gross chromosome damage was visible. Dr. Knudson found that some children with the eye cancer had inherited a damaged copy of chromosome No. 13 from a parent who had had the disease. Under a microscope he could actually see that a bit of chromosome 13 was missing. He assumed the missing piece contained a gene or genes whose loss had a critical role in setting off the cancer. But he didn't know which gene or genes had disappeared.

For individuals, the Packwood plan would exclude from income 5% of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than one year. The exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year the asset was held until it reached a maximum of 35%. The exclusion would apply to assets sold after Oct. 1, 1989. As an alternative, he said, taxpayers could chose to reduce their gains by an inflation index.

There has been a lot of talk that a large portion of the Colombian economy is sustained by the laundering of drug money. In my opinion, this is not true. Laundered drug money has served only to increase, unrealistically, the price of real estate, creating serious problems for low-income people who aspire to own their own homes. Drug money has also gone to buy expensive cars, airplanes, launches and nightclubs where drugs are consumed. But most of the drug money is kept in investments and in financial institutions outside Colombia. In fact, the cooperation of those financial institutions is essential to the success of the drug battle.

Judges Oakes and Leval understand the requirements of historical scholarship. Judges Miner and Altimari do not appear to have a clue. Yet at the moment they are the judges who are making the law. As matters stand, the Salinger ruling, torn from context and broadly construed, is controlling. If an author quotes “more than minimal amounts” of unpublished copyrighted materials, as the Salinger decision had it, “he deserves to be enjoined.” The courts have not defined “minimal amounts,” but publishers, I understand, take it to mean about 50 words. The “Bare-Faced Messiah” decision strikes a blow against the whole historical enterprise. A second decision, handed down in August by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, is another blow against scholarship. Janet Malcolm, a professional writer on psychiatric matters, wrote a series of articles for the New Yorker, later published in book form by Knopf under the title “In the Freud Archives.” The articles were largely based on interviews Ms. Malcolm had taped with Jeffrey Masson, a psychoanalyst who had served as projects director of the Freud Archives.

Paying players at SMU was no casual operation. It involved the athletics director, two different football coaching staffs, and school trustees and governors - just about everybody, it seemed, but Donald Shields, the university's president. There's a memorable passage in which Mr. Shields, having finally learned of the practice, expresses his outrage to Bill Clements, then a university governor (and now the governor of Texas!) and oil man Edwin Cox, chairman of the board of trustees.

Mr.M'Bow was an extreme case, but even his replacement, the more personally genial Spanish biochemist Federico Mayor, has had little success at achieving reforms. Several ridiculous projects continue, including the “New International Economic Order,” which means redistributionism from the West to pay for everyone else's statism.

Housing, for instance, has remained a fairly steady component of household assets over the past decade - although common wisdom would have expected an increase. “There is a lot of attention paid to housing as a form of household wealth,” says Edward N. Wolff, professor of economics at New York University. “But it hasn't increased much relative to other assets. It suggests that households accumulate wealth across a broad spectrum of assets. And housing though it appears in the popular mind as being the major {growing} household asset, isn't.”

So it seems that Mr. Mitsotakis and his communist chums may have unwittingly served Mr. Papandreou a moral victory on a platter: PASOK, whether guilty or not, can now traipse the countryside condemning the whole affair as a witch hunt at Mr. Papandreou's expense.

Brands made by the Kraft General Foods unit of Philip Morris Cos. had about 95% of the market share. Nestle currently has only about a 2% share with its Taster's Choice coffee.

But some large insurers, such as State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., don't purchase reinsurance, but fund their own program. A few years ago, State Farm, the nation's largest home insurer, stopped buying reinsurance because no one carrier could provide all the coverage that it needed and the company found it cheaper to self-reinsure. The $472 million of losses State Farm expects from Hugo and an additional $300 million from the earthquake are less than 5% of State Farm's $16.7 billion total net worth.

The estimated $1.8 billion for the space station would be double last year's level, and total appropriations for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration would grow 16% to nearly $12.4 billion. A string of costly projects, including the high-speed national aerospace plane and the advanced communications technology satellite, would continue to be developed within these limits.

A Soviet legislative panel rejected as not radical enough a government proposal on decentralizing economic control. The newspaper Leninskoye Zamya said the committee decided the plan to parcel out economic powers previously exercised by Moscow to the country's 15 republics “doesn't reflect the radical changes in the Soviet federation.” The committee gave the government until Nov. 15 to revise the proposal. The move reflected the growing confidence of the revamped Supreme Soviet.

Accepted theories of asset pricing offer a perfectly legitimate explanation. Accepted theories state that investors require higher returns on riskier investments. Thus, rather than seeing the excess returns to the pro-selected portfolio as being abnormal, I see those returns as simply compensations for taking on added risk. I believe the risk for each individual stock selected by your pros is very large. If you asked me to select a stock with the highest expected return, I would select a stock with the greatest amount of undiversifiable risk, as I am sure your pros do. Your hypothetical investor is simply being compensated for taking on this added risk.

CDs sold by major brokerage houses, which like jumbo CDs tend to closely follow interest rate trends, also posted larger drops in yields. A six-month, broker-sold CD, for example, was yielding an average 8.09% in the latest week, a fifth of a percentage point lower than the week before. In late April, when interest rates were at their recent highs, short-term CDs sold by brokers were offering yields half a percentage point or more higher than banks.

At issue is the deductibility of certain junk bonds that are used in most LBOs. Such high-yield debt is similar to a zero-coupon bond in that it is sold at a discount to face value, with interest accruing instead of being paid to the holder.

There's nothing in the least contradictory in all this, and it would be nice to think that Washington could tolerate a reasonably sophisticated, complex view. Yet much of the political culture seems intent on castigating the Bush administration for not “helping” Mr. Gorbachev.

Mr. Stoll draws his title from the cuckoo's habit of laying eggs in the nests of other birds, making them surrogate parents. The computer spy had discovered that a popular editing\/electronic mail program called Gnu-Emacs could do tricks with the widely used Unix operating system created by AT&T. Using Gnu-Emacs, the spy could substitute a bogus “atrun” program for the one that routinely cleans up the Unix system every five minutes. Once his cuckoo's egg was laid, he could enter Unix and become a “super-user,” with access to everything.

Its backers fielded every important interest on their team - a popular mayor, the Chamber of Commerce, the major media - and spent $100,000 on promotion.

While it is still too early to tell whether the dearth of takeover activity is only temporary, many lawyers say their firms are bracing for lower revenue from merger work, which has been so lucrative in the past. Much of this work was done for higher fees than other legal work and was not generally billed by the hour.

Not so the Soviets. Gen. Gromov himself said Soviet troops expected to leave behind more than $1 billion of military equipment and installations for the Kabul regime. Since the troop withdrawal, Moscow has poured in an additional $200 to $300 million worth per month - nearly $2 billion since February, equivalent to the total U.S. aid to the resistance in nine years. This includes what Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov fetchingly called “new peaceful long-range weapons,” including more than 800 SCUD missiles. By early May, Moscow had delivered, for example, 1,000 trucks, about 100 tanks, artillery and hundreds of other combat vehicles. Later that month, it added an entire tank brigade, including 120 T-72 tanks and more than 40 BMP state-of-the-art infantry fighting vehicles. By September, a new Reinforced Motorized Rifle Brigade with an additional 300 combat vehicles, 1,000 more trucks and 10,000 Soviet-trained Afghan troops had arrived in Kandahar. In the last few weeks, Moscow has added FROG-7B missiles, the bomber version of the An-12, MiG-23BN high-altitude aircraft, MiG-29s, which can outfly Pakistan's U.S.-built F16s, and Sukhoi SU-27 fighter-bombers, which can outfly the MiG-29s.

CNN wants to change its viewers' habits. Its watchers are, on the whole, a disloyal group of channel-zapping “grazers” and news junkies, who spend an average of just 26 minutes a day watching CNN, according to audience research. That's less than one-third the time that viewers watch the major broadcast networks. The brief attention viewers give CNN could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data, and advertising, become more important to cable-TV channels.

A pivotal test will come in the next 18 months, according to bankers and money managers familiar with the buy-out. Some time before April 1991, RJR must fix the interest rates on $5.8 billion worth of PIK bonds so the notes trade at par, in accordance with the bonds' terms. That means if the notes continue trading below their $100 par value - they are now trading below $80 (excluding accrued interest) - RJR must boost the bonds' interest rates as high as necessary to drive their market price to $100. That could require fixing the interest rate as high as 20%, bankers say, especially if the junk-bond market remains weak or deteriorates further.

A case in point: “government-plus” bond funds. What could imply more safety than investing in government bonds? What could be better than getting a tad more income from them (the plus) than other people? Indeed, conservative investors, many of them elderly, have poured more than $50 billion into such funds, which promise fatter yields than ordinary Treasury bonds - only to learn later that these funds use part of their money to dabble in high-risk bond options, a gambler's game.

PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices declined. A number of developments were negatively interpreted by traders. December delivery gold fell $1.80 an ounce to $370.60. December silver eased 2.7 cents an ounce to $5.133. January platinum was down $3.60 an ounce at $491.10. One price-depressing development was the lower-than-expected increase of only 0.2% in the consumer price index for September, an analyst said. He noted that the “core inflation rate,” which excludes food and energy, was also low at 0.2%. Other news that weighed on the market: Initial unemployment claims rose by 62,000 last week; American Telephone & Telegraph Co. will reduce its managerial staff by 15,000 through attrition; the oil market turned weaker; there wasn't any investor demand for bullion; and the dollar strengthened during the day, putting pressure on gold. Also, the analyst said, economic circumstances are such that both South Africa and the Soviet Union, the principal gold and platinum producers, are being forced to continue selling the metals. Both are in great need of foreign exchange, and South Africa is also under pressure to meet foreign loan commitments, he said. “Putting it all together, we have a negative scenario that doesn't look like it will improve overnight,” he said.

Another lifelong complication, as Phyllis Rose makes clear in “Jazz Cleopatra: Josephine Baker in Her Time” (Doubleday, 321 pages, $22.50), was racism. Baker had the good luck to arrive in 1925 Paris, where blacks had become exotic. African art was in vogue and some intellectuals were writing breathlessly of a dawning age to be inspired by blacks. To be exotic was to be patronized as well as prized, but for the most part Paris was a friendly island in a racist world. Baker had bitter experience of bigotry from her St. Louis childhood and her days in New York theater, where she was judged too dark for an all-black chorus line (performing of course for all-white audiences).

To me, this calls into question the validity of the Rowland-Molina theory and hence the whole chlorofluorocarbons replacement effort.

The president specifically mentioned U.S. economic advice to Moscow as a possible topic. Mr. Gorbachev has for months been publicly urging the U.S. to drop its restrictions on Soviet trade. He recently told a small group of American businessmen in Moscow that he hoped to sign a general trade agreement with the U.S., possibly at the 1990 summit.

Clearly not. About 20,000 years ago the last ice age ended. Enormous ice sheets retreated from the face of North America, northern Europe and Asia. This global warming must have been entirely natural - nobody would blame it on a few hundred thousand hunter-gatherers hunting mammoths and scratching around in caves. Furthermore, no bell has yet rung to announce the end of this immense episode of natural global warming. It is probably continuing and may well account for most of, or all of, present-day global warming.

The Big Board has refused to be drawn into a public debate about program trading. Richard Grasso, Big Board president, last week said only that the exchange is concerned about all its constituents. Privately, exchange officials worry that without a hospitable system for program trading at the Big Board, billions of dollars in trading will simply migrate to overseas exchanges such as London's. It is partly for this reason that the exchange last week began trading in its own stock “basket” product that allows big investors to buy or sell all 500 stocks in the Standard & Poor's index in a single trade. One intended customer of the new basket product is index arbitragers, according to the exchange.

I approached “Mastergate,” Larry Gelbart's new comedy at the Criterion Center, with considerable trepidation. Nothing, I assumed, would be more hopelessly dated than a political satire on the Iran-Contra affair. I had underestimated, however, both Mr. Gelbart's wit and the persistence of scandal in Washington. Though the play clearly is framed around the events of Iran-Contra, it takes in the wide sweep of scandals over the past 30 years. In fact, at one point Merry Chase (Melinda Mullins), a cool, carefully coiffed television announcer, recites a list of a dozen or more scandals of recent years, concluding with those affecting the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the savings and loan industry.

Mr. Batchelder says that in the past, banks would normally have loaned 65% of a total buy-out price, with the loans secured by the target company's assets.

Mr. Checchi's purchase of NWA, Mr. Batchelder notes, “was probably the most aggressive to date,” with bank debt at 85% of the purchase price.

Mr. Oriani said his skepticism of the Utah claims was initially confirmed when his first experiments last spring failed to produce results. But he then borrowed a palladium rod from chemists at Texas A&M who said they were getting excess heat. “The results were fascinating,” he said. On the fourth “run” with the borrowed rod, the experiment began producing excess heat. The experiment was stopped briefly to change an instrument. When it was restarted, heat output “really took off” and produced excess heat for several hours before dying down, he said.

Many American church-owned businesses, such as a $30 million factory to build fishing vessels, are defunct. Some components of the American church had their budgets cut in half last year and again this year. The relatively small academic conferences that have attracted conservative guests - and press scrutiny - in recent years are much more narrowly targeted and austere than the thousand-person get-togethers in fancy digs and exotic locales of years past. I attended several of these in the dual role as a presenter of research findings as well as an investigator of my hosts. (Mr. Moon's Paragon House eventually even published three of my co-edited books on religion and politics.)

The probe, which is painless, non-invasive and apparently harmless, employs strong magnetic fields to induce small whirlwinds of electricity within the brain. If positioned over the brain's motor-control area, the hand-held electromagnets generate nerve impulses that zip down motor nerves and activate muscles, making, say, a finger twitch. In principle, they will enable doctors to check the body's motor system the way an electrician tests a home's electrical circuits by running current through them.

Earlier this year, President Bush made a final “take-it-or-leave it” offer on the minimum wage: an increase to $4.25 an hour over three years, and only if accompanied by a lower wage for the first six months of a job. Now, the White House has decided to accept the higher wage over only two years. The sub-minimum wage would apply only to first-time teen-age workers for 90 days. The White House had enough votes to sustain a veto but chose to avoid a confrontation. The only permanent losers will be the 200,000 or so workers everyone agrees will be priced out of a job at the $4.25 rate Congress is likely to approve today. It is compromises such as this that convince Washington's liberals that if they simply stay the course, this administration will stray from its own course on this and other issues.

Today a President can still send up spending rescissions, but they're meaningless unless Congress has a guilty conscience and changes its mind. This is like asking foxes to feel remorse about chickens, and naturally rescissions are almost never approved. In 1987, President Reagan sent 73 rescissions back to the Hill, but only 3% of the spending total was approved by Congress. Senator Coats's proposal would let the proposed spending cuts take place automatically unless Congress acts. The Members could still try to serve their constituents with special-interest goodies, but the police (in the form of a President) would be there with a straitjacket if they really get crazy, as they do now.

Like most treasury secretaries, Mr. Brady takes a keen interest in monetary matters, of course. He was, in fact, taking an especially keen interest in board matters even before he went to the treasury. After the October 1987 market crash, Mr. Brady as a private citizen headed a presidential commission that tried to decide what went wrong and what should be done about it. One of the commission's recommendations was that a single agency, probably the Federal Reserve, should coordinate regulation of all financial markets.

The market for so-called junk bonds has been setting the stage for Friday's dramatic march for several weeks. The growing financial difficulties of recent high-leverage restructurings or takeovers, such as Resorts International, Integrated Resources, and Campeau's retailing empire, have cast a pall over the entire market for high-yield securities. Investors have reacted by ignoring recent efforts to float junk bonds by Ohio Mattress and by forcing Ramada to postpone indefinitely its planned junk-bond sale and restructuring. As a result, high-yield mutual funds have declined across the board and the many firms planning to sell $11 billion in junk bonds before year-end are experiencing anxious times.

The true budgetary cost of a credit subsidy is the discounted value of the net costs to government. This figure could be estimated using techniques employed by private lenders to forecast losses, or determined by selling loans to private owners (without federal guarantees). Neither technique is perfect, but both are better than the current system, which misstates the costs of new credit programs by amounts that vary substantially and average about $20 billion annually, according to the Congressional Budget Office. A budget that reflected the real costs of lending would eliminate incentives to convert spending or lending programs to guarantees and would let taxpayers know what Congress is committing them to.

Analysts agree, predicting that the revived market could significantly boost Westinghouse's bottom line in coming years. “Westinghouse's earnings could be materially enhanced in the mid-1990s or sooner,” says Russell L.

Already this year, it has received orders for four 150-megawatt advanced combustion turbines from Florida Power & Light Co. and for two 300-megawatt plants from Intercontinental Energy Corp., among others.

The Diaghilev material is less interesting. The Ballets Russes never appeared in Russia and most of the important artifacts are in the West. George Balanchine, to whom Ms. Geva was married as a teenager in 1923 and who began his career as an artistic revolutionary, also gets short shrift. Better by far is the representation accorded the avant-garde dance that flourished in the U.S.S.R. until ruthlessly repressed during the Stalin years. The presence of so much material concerning Feodor Lopukhov, the leading choreographer of the post-Revolutionary Leningrad school, and virtually unknown in this country, is particularly welcome.

2. “Service” should be service. As commonly understood, service implies sacrifice. It involves accepting risk, or giving up income, or deferring a career. It follows that proposals like Nunn-McCurdy, whose benefits to enrollees are worth some $17,500 a year, do not qualify. There is a rationale for such bills: Federal subsidies to college students amount to “a GI Bill without the GI”; arguably those benefits should be earned, not given. But the earnings exceed by 20% the average income of young high-school graduates with full-time jobs. Why call that service?

The market opened at what proved to be its high and continued to slip toward the end of the day. Traders said the reason its drop was larger than Wednesday's moderate loss was that investors began selling their holdings when they saw that Wednesday's rise to 3.75% in the discount rate - the central bank's base rate on loans to commercial banks - failed to curb the dollar's rise against the yen.

COPPER: Futures prices recovered in quiet trading. The December contract rose 1.50 cents a pound to $1.2795. That contract fell a total of 5.75 cents during the first three days of this week, mostly in reaction to last Friday's stock market plunge, which prompted concern that it might signal a similar sharp slowing of the U.S. economy and thus reduced demand for copper, a leading industrial metal. In recent days, however, there has been increased purchasing of copper in London, an analyst said. Some of this buying was by Japan, which has had its supplies sharply reduced by long production stoppages at the Bougainville mine in Papua New Guinea, Highland Valley mine in British Columbia, and the Cananea mine in Mexico, which are major shippers to Japan. The increasing likelihood that Cananea and Highland Valley will soon return to production may have cut some of that purchasing, but even if any of these mines begin operating soon, their output won't be significant until at least the end of the year, analysts note. So, one analyst said, even though the long-term production problems may be easing, there will still be a significant need for copper over the next three months, when inventories will remain relatively low.

COPPER: Futures prices fell and showed little rebound as one major labor problem that had been underpinning prices appeared to be solved. The December contract declined 3.05 cents a pound to $1.2745. Prices were down from the outset of trading on concern that a drop in the stock market might create a weakened economy and a consequent reduction in copper use. But the recovery in the stock market provided little help for copper as word spread that a three-month strike at the Highland Valley mine in British Columbia was about over, according to an analyst. Highland Valley is a large Canadian producer and principal supplier to Japan, which recently began seeking copper elsewhere as its inventories shrank. Last week it was reported that company and union negotiations had overcome the major hurdle, the contracting out of work by the company. Now, the analyst said, only minor points remain to be cleaned up. “For all intents and purposes, an agreement appears to have been achieved,” he said. Copper inventories in New York's Commodity Exchange warehouses rose yesterday by 516 tons, to 10,004 tons. London Metal Exchange copper inventories last week declined 13,575 tons, to 89,300 tons. The LME stocks decline was about as expected, but the Comex gain wasn't. However, this was brushed aside by concern over the stock market, the analyst said. At one point in futures trading, as the stock market firmed, the December contract rose to as high as $1.2965, but it wasn't able to sustain the gain. “It was simply overbought,” he said, and selling by funds that are computer guided helped depress prices.

Far from promoting a commonality of interests among black, white, Hispanic and other minority voters, drawing the district lines according to race suggests that race is the voter's and the candidate's most important trait. Such a policy implies that only a black politician can speak for a black person, and that only a white politician can govern on behalf of a white one. Examples of the divisive effects of racial gerrymandering can be seen in two cities - New York and Birmingham, Ala. When they reapportion their districts after the 1990 census, every other municipality and state in the country will face this issue. New York City: Racial gerrymandering has been a familiar policy in New York City since 1970, when Congress first amended the Voting Rights Act to expand its reach beyond the Southern states. In 1972, the Justice Department required that the electoral map in the borough of Brooklyn be redrawn to concentrate black and Hispanic votes, despite protests that the new electoral boundaries would split a neighborhood of Hasidic Jews into two different districts.

The ad campaigns usually follow one of three tracks - stressing the company's “Texasness,” pointing out the competition's lack thereof, or trying to be more Texan than Texans. Ford trucks may outsell Chevy trucks in places like “Connecticut and Long Island,” sniffs a commercial for Chevrolet, a division of General Motors Corp. The commercial, created by Bateman, Bryan & Galles Inc., of Dallas, adds derisively: “I bet it takes a real tough truck to haul your Ivy League buddies to the yacht club.” Because they want a truck that is “Texas tough,” the commercial concludes, “Texans drive Chevy.”

“This isn't a political issue, this is a moral issue,” said Rep. Henry Hyde (R., Ill.), the most eloquent spokesman for the anti-abortion movement.

Stock-index arbitrage, because it sells the more “expensive” market and buys the “cheaper” one, attempts to reestablish the link between the stock and futures markets, and the adjustments are often abrupt. But unequal trading rules allow the futures market to trade differently from stocks, which invites frequent bouts of stock-index arbitrage in the first place.

Limit Order: Limit orders are used when investors want to restrict the amount they will receive or pay for an investment. Investors do this by specifying a minimum price at which the investment may be sold or the maximum price that may be paid for it. Suppose an investor wants to sell a stock, but not for less than $55. A limit order to sell could be entered at that price. One risk: Investors may regret the restriction if the stock reaches 54 and then falls.

Researchers in Edinburgh, Scotland, have found that in 23 of 38 breast tumors, one copy of chromosome 17 was mutated at the spot where gene p53 lies.

The need for hurried last-minute telephone negotiations among market officials will disappear once rules are in place that synchronize circuit breakers in all markets. The new circuit breakers, if they are to be applied at all, will require that futures and options trading continue as long as the New York Stock Exchange remains open.

In many ways, our financial markets are better prepared today to handle a decline than they were two years ago. The New York Stock Exchange now has the capacity to handle a volume of nearly a billion shares a day. Telephone service has been improved for customers trying to reach their brokers, and specialists - who I believe should stay, despite the urgings of some post-crash critics - have larger capital positions. (Of course, specialists' actions alone can never prevent a major crack in stock prices. Witness the fact that trading in some stocks closed early Friday and opened late Monday because of an excess of sell orders.) But the task of improving market performance remains unfinished.

If you can swallow the premise that the rewards for such ineptitude are six-figure salaries, you still are left puzzled, because few of the yuppies consume very conspicuously. In fact, few consume much of anything. Two share a house almost devoid of furniture. Michelle lives in a hotel room, and although she drives a canary-colored Porsche, she hasn't time to clean or repair it; the beat-up vehicle can be started only with a huge pair of pliers because the ignition key has broken off in the lock. And it takes Declan, the obligatory ladies' man of the cast, until the third episode to get past first base with any of his prey.

That the motivation for the two-year reduction to 19.6% is budgetary does not mean it is not in the public interest. The reduction eases the burden on portfolio changes and frees capital to seek more productive or more appropriate uses. But what is really significant is the indexation of capital gains after 1991. To argue that this is “not likely” to affect the economy in positive ways is contrary both to recent experience with capital-gains tax cuts and to common sense. A large part of the long-term appreciation of assets reflects inflation, and the taxation of inflation-created capital gains is confiscation. Does the Journal really believe that people ignore the prospect of having a substantial part of their capital confiscated when they decide whether to save or how to invest?

With Japanese companies in a wide range of industries - from heavy industry to securities firms - increasing their market share world-wide, the prospect of an even more efficient Japanese economic army may rattle foreigners. But it also offers opportunities; Americans are well poised to supply the weapons. Japan may be a tough market for outsiders to penetrate, and the U.S. is hopelessly behind Japan in certain technologies. But for now, at least, Americans are far better at making PCs and the software that runs them.

Anheuser said its new strategy - started in some markets last month and expected to be applied soon in selected markets nationwide - will mean lower-than-anticipated earnings for the last half of 1989 and for 1990. The projection sent Anheuser shares plunging $4.375 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. The stock closed at $38.50 on heavy volume of about 3.5 million shares. Shares of Coors, the company's sole publicly traded major competitor, fell $1.50 apiece to $19.125 in national over-the-counter trading, apparently on investor concerns over potential fallout from the coming pricing struggle.

An additional piece of evidence from the Senate: Holding other factors constant, such as incumbency advantages and regional factors, the difference between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election turns out to be a positive function of how onerous the federal government's tax burden is per state (a progressive tax rate hits higher-income states harder).

Virginia: Democratic Lt. Gov.

Then, just as an image of the statue of Thomas Jefferson dissolves from the screen, the announcer continues: “On the issue of abortion, Marshall Coleman wants to take away your right to choose and give it to the politicians.”

LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: The Agriculture Department is expected to announce tomorrow that the number of cattle in the 13 major ranch states slipped 4% to 8.21 million on Oct. 1 compared with the level a year earlier, said Tom Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp., Arlington Heights, Ill. Cattle prices have risen in recent weeks on speculation that the government's quarterly report will signal tighter supplies of beef. Among other things, the government is expected to report that the number of young cattle placed on feedlots during the quarter slipped 3%. Feedlots fatten cattle for slaughter, so a drop indicates that the production of beef will dip this winter. Indeed, some analysts expect the government to report that the movement of young cattle onto feedlots in the month of September in seven big ranch states dropped 8% compared with the level for September 1988.

These and other expensive changes in products ranging from auto air conditioners to foam cushioning to commercial solvents are in prospect because of something called the Montreal Protocol, signed by 24 nations in 1987. In one of the most sweeping environmental regulatory efforts to date - involving products with an annual value of $135 billion in the U.S. alone - the signatories agreed to curtail sharply the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). World-wide production would be cut in half by 1998. The U.S. Senate liked the treaty so well it ratified it by a vote of 89 to 0. Not to be outdone, George Bush wants CFCs banished altogether by the year 2000, a goal endorsed at an 80-nation U.N. environmental meeting in Helsinki in the spring.

Funds for drilling may inch up more next year if oil prices stay stable. Texaco, thinking in terms of $18-to-$19 oil for 1990, may raise spending, especially for low-risk prospects, an official says.

Although “it's still difficult to raise money for a pure wildcat program,” says William Thomas, a Texas Commerce Bank official in Houston, “institutions are starting to see there are cycles to these things, and this one is beginning to turn.”

The federal mail and wire fraud statutes provide even better illustrations of the rapid evolution of a federal common law of white-collar crime. In 1987, the Supreme Court attempted in McNally v.

Yet, late last year, Congress effectively reversed this decision by enacting a one-sentence statute that defined fraud to include any scheme to deprive another of “the intangible right of honest services.” At a stroke, this may criminalize all fiduciary breaches (and possibly all misrepresentations by an agent or employee).

LOCKHEED CORP., Calabasas, aerospace and defense concern, annual sales of $10.59 billion, NYSE, said its Lockheed Missiles & Space division closed its Santa Cruz test facility because of power outages and landslides. The closing, affecting 266 employees, will continue at least until roads are cleared. It wasn't known to what extent, if any, the facility was damaged. It also wasn't known what the impact will be on the division's work, which includes the Navy's Trident submarine-based missile program and the Air Force's Strategic Defense Initiative. The division had only minor damage at its Sunnyvale headquarters and plant in Palo Altos, and no delays in deliveries are expected.

Mr. Jobs said the changes were prompted by requests from customers who are frustrated with the performance of the optical device, which isn't offered as standard equipment by any rivals. Another factor was that customers were asking, “Why don't you give us a cheaper system?” Mr. Jobs said at a conference on university computing here. Optical-storage devices can handle very large amounts of data and make it far easier to edit film clips or audio recordings with a computer. But the technology, while reliable, is far slower than the widely used hard drives.

Furthermore, the regulatory maneuvering behind First Interstate's loss suggests regulators have concluded that lenders' reserves are far too low to absorb their future Arizona losses and are forcing bankers to do something about it. Examiners from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency had been combing through First Interstate's real-estate portfolio since last month; they first recommended that First Interstate take a provision that was less than the eventual $350 million third-quarter hit. When First Interstate balked, arguing that the figure was too high, regulators responded by raising their recommendation to $350 million.

The newly identified genes differ from a family of genes discovered in the early 1980s called oncogenes. Oncogenes must be present for a cell to become malignant, but researchers have found them in normal as well as in cancerous cells, suggesting that oncogenes don't cause cancer by themselves. In recent months, researchers have come to believe the two types of cancer genes work in concert: An oncogene may turn proliferating cells malignant only after the tumor-suppressor gene has been damaged.

HomeFed said the slide in loan originations was more a matter of design than a sign of cooling in the California market. Any such downturn in California would be grim news for West Coast thrifts, particularly the less healthy ones, which have performed poorly even with a torrid market. But HomeFed said it purposely curbed loan originations in the quarter because of uncertainty over the new capital requirements and regulations that will emerge from negotiations over implementing the government's massive thrift bailout bill. It said its real-estate operations earned a record $21.7 million, more than double year-earlier real estate profit of $9 million. And analysts said they see no signs of an imminent swoon in California real estate, even with last week's earthquake.

He also is a consensus manager, insiders say.

Assuming that post at the age of 35, he managed by consensus, as is the rule in universities, says Warren H. Strother, a university official who is researching a book on Mr. Hahn.

Meanwhile, Toyota Motor Corp.'s $247 million buildup is increasing its annual capacity by 180,000 cars, and Honda is spending $317 million on expansion. Mazda Motor Corp. is still considering its options, but it boldly aims to double its annual domestic sales to 800,000 cars in the next four years.

The chart below shows why (see accompanying illustration - WSJ Oct. 23, 1989). The ratio of consumer installment credit to disposable income, though up a bit, hasn't climbed steeply, and such debt as a percent of household assets is little changed. Moreover, the burden of consumer credit payments relative to disposable income may be “lower in this cycle than earlier,” Mr. Durkin says. He notes that some “revolving credit-card credit is actually convenience credit” being used simply as a handy way of paying bills rather than a handy way of borrowing. In addition, he says, “longer maturities on automobile and other forms of installment credit boost the stock of debt faster than the flow of repayments and the accompanying payment burden.”

Built into the statute are so-called design immunities, which are likely to protect government agencies, according to Mr. Ruvolo and Richard Covert, a lawyer with the California Department of Transportation, which oversees the damaged Bay Bridge. The state is protected when plans and designs for public structures were approved ahead of time or when structures met previously approved standards, says Mr. Covert. He believes those defenses might well apply to the Bay Bridge collapse. Nevertheless, he adds, “I wouldn't get totally shocked if we get lawsuits out of the Bay Bridge.”

Levki Gevergeyev had a passion for learning and for the arts, especially the performing arts. In addition to his holdings of theatrical material, he also owned 50,000 books, among them a great cache of bibles, although, in fact, he was an atheist. That didn't keep him from making a great deal of money manufacturing gold vestments for the Russian Orthodox Church. He owned a 26-room house, in which, according to his daughter, four enormous rooms were filled with his collection.

Many fly-by-night charities ride the coattails of the biggest, best-known and most reputable ones by adopting names similar to theirs. The established charities are bothered by this but say they can do little about it. “We can't police the many organizations that have sprung up in the last few years using part of our name. Most of them don't last for long, but in the meantime all we can do is tell people they aren't connected with us,” says a spokeswoman for the American Heart Association. And sometimes a reputable charity with a household name gets used and doesn't even know it. A couple in Rockford, Ill., raised $12,591 earlier this year using the name and logo of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, without permission from the group. MADD didn't learn of the fund raising until the couple sent it a check for $613, along with a letter saying that was the charity's “share.”

Encouraging long-term investing. We must be very cautious about labeling investors as “long-term” or “short-term.” Policies designed to encourage one type of investor over another are akin to placing a sign over the Big Board's door saying: “Buyers welcome, sellers please go away!” The ultimate goal of any investor is a profit motive, and regulators should not concern themselves with whether investors are sufficiently focused on the long term.

Such a pace of growth, though respectable for mature industrialized economies, would be unusually slow for Hong Kong. Only twice since the 1960s has annual gross domestic product growth here fallen below 5% for two or more consecutive years. The first instance occurred in 1967-68, when China's Cultural Revolution triggered bloody street rioting in the colony. The other came in 1974-75 from the combined shock of world recession and a severe local stock market crash. During the past 10 years, Hong Kong's economic growth has averaged 8.3% annually. Given Hong Kong's record, Mr. Mushkat's “realists” might have sounded unduly conservative when the interviews took place two years ago.

The high-tech industry is full of the kind of arrangement that the new guidelines would affect. For instance, Commonwealth BioVentures Inc., a venture-capital concern, last month invested $600,000 to launch Amira Inc., a Worcester, Mass., concern that will produce pharmaceuticals. Scientists Rima Kaddurah-Daouk and Paul Schimmel conducted the initial research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. While Ms. Kaddurah-Daouk left MIT to head Amira, Prof. Schimmel will continue to work at MIT, serve on Amira's board and own a small equity stake in the company.

But the apple industry is ripe for change. “Red Delicious has been overplanted, and its prices have dropped below the cost of production,” says Washington State's Mr. Norton. The scare over Alar, a growth regulator that makes apples redder and crunchier but may be carcinogenic, made consumers shy away from the Delicious, though they were less affected than the McIntosh. The glut and consequent lower prices, combined with cancer fears, was a very serious blow to growers. “A lot of growers won't be around in a few years,” says Mr. Norton, although they have stopped using Alar.

“Mr. Hunt's attempt to squeeze the silver market 10 years ago is still indirectly to blame for today's market depression,” says Lesley Edgar, managing director of Sharps Pixley Ltd., London bullion brokers. While some 100 million ounces of silver once held by Mr. Hunt and Middle Eastern associates aren't hanging over the market anymore, the price surge of 1979-80 precipitated an expansion of mine production and scrap recovery and encouraged silver consumers to economize on silver use, Mr. Edgar says.

Mr. Asman should make distinctions among Fidel, the army and the Cuban people. They are not interchangeable, since they are motivated to act based on their own circumstances. It is naivete to equate a government's policies with the will of the people (as we well know), and it is even worse folly to merge the clearly divergent agendas of Fidel and the military and the state bureaucracy. Mr. Asman is also annoyed that Mr. Castro has resisted collaboration with U.S. officials, even though by his own account that collaboration has been devised essentially as a mechanism for acts directly hostile to the Cuban regime, such as facilitating defections. I think it's a little disingenuous to be surprised that Fidel doesn't invite the U.S. State Department to violate the jurisdiction of the Cuban government over its own territory.

Futures-related selling pushed the industrial average about 45 points lower in the morning as rumors about RJR Nabisco's pending sale of its Del Monte foods unit spread through the trading pits in Chicago. The purchase of Del Monte is likely to be financed with junk bonds or a bridge loan. The stock market has had a heightened concern about turmoil with high-risk financing ever since Campeau Corp. nearly missed an interest payment on its junk bonds in September.

Congress has been critical of the Bush administration for not sending enough aid to Poland, so it is getting ready to send its own version of a CARE package. Last month, the Senate voted to send a delegation of congressional staffers to Poland to assist its legislature, the Sejm, in democratic procedures. Senator Pete Domenici calls this effort “the first gift of democracy.” The Poles might do better to view it as a Trojan Horse.

He also is an entertaining writer, combining wisecracks and wordplay with programmatic detail and lucid explanations of how computers work.

Second, if the key assumption is valid, Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking.

The biggest foreign inroads, though, have been made by bourbon. While U.S. makers of vodka, rum and other spirits compete against powerhouses abroad, trade agreements prohibit any other country from making bourbon. (All bourbon comes from Kentucky, though Jack Daniel's Tennessee whiskey often is counted as bourbon because of similarity of taste.) Moreover, just as vodka has acquired an upscale image in the U.S., bourbon has become fashionable in many foreign countries, a uniquely American product tied to frontier folklore.

The centerpiece of the promotion is its new ad campaign, into which the magazine will pour about $500,000, mostly in the next few weeks. The campaign, created by Omnicom Group's DDB Needham agency, takes advantage of the eye-catching photography that National Geographic is known for. In one ad, a photo of the interior of the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris is paired with the headline, “The only book more respected than ours doesn't accept advertising.” Another ad pictures a tree ant, magnified 80 times, with the headline, “For impact far beyond your size consider our regional editions.”

The best of the crop was last week's season premiere of “In the Heat of the Night,” the NBC series based on a 1967 feature film about a black Philadelphia police detective in a small Southern town. In the series, Virgil Tibbs (Howard Rollins) and his wife, Althea (Anne-Marie Johnson) have settled in Sparta, Miss. Because the show has acquired a sense of place by being filmed on location in Georgia, this episode - in which Althea gets raped by an arrogant white schoolteacher - does a decent job of tracing the social repercussions of the crime.

If the setting is exotic, the prose is closer to Balzac's “Pere Goriot” than it is to “Arabian Nights.” Mr. Mahfouz began writing when there was no novelistic tradition in Arabic, and he modeled his work on Western classics. In one sense, this limits him; unlike a writer such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who has a distinctive Latin voice, Mr. Mahfouz's style offers little that can be labeled “Egyptian.” But the familiarity of his style also makes his work accessible, as the streets of Cairo come alive for the Western reader as vividly as Dickens's London or Dostoevski's St. Petersburg.

The potential sales are nearly $9.3 million, and House Majority Whip William Gray (D., Pa.) began the bidding this year by proposing language that the quota be allocated to English-speaking countries of the Caribbean, such as Jamaica and Barbados. Rep. Jerry Lewis, a conservative Californian, added a provision of his own intended to assist Bolivia, and the Senate then broadened the list further by including all countries in the U.S. Caribbean Basin initiate as well as the Philippines - backed by the powerful Hawaii Democrat Sen. Daniel Inouye. Jamaica, wary of upsetting its Caribbean Basin allies, has apparently instructed its lobbyist to abandon the provision initially drafted by Mr. Gray, but the greater question is whether Mr. Inouye, who has strong ties to the sugar industry, is able to insert a claim by the Philippines.

It has always been so. In the 1920s, a young schoolteacher, John T. Scopes, volunteered to be a guinea pig in a test case sponsored by the American Civil Liberties Union to challenge a ban on the teaching of evolution imposed by the Tennessee Legislature. The result was a world-famous trial exposing profound cultural conflicts in American life between the “smart set,” whose spokesman was H.L. Mencken, and the religious fundamentalists, whom Mencken derided as benighted primitives. Few now recall the actual outcome: Scopes was convicted and fined $100, and his conviction was reversed on appeal because the fine was excessive under Tennessee law.

In fact, last Friday's 190.58-point tumble in the stock market caught many people and businesses by surprise, not the least of them brokerage firms such as Shearson that print their weekly market commentaries on Fridays for dissemination the following week. Shearson, a 62%-owned unit of American Express Co., didn't have enough time to update its market commentary so, “We decided to kill our strategy pieces,” says Jack Rivkin, the head of Shearson's research department.

An example is the biggest offering of them all, Larsen & Toubro's $570 million bond issue. The engineering company was acquired in a takeover earlier this year by the giant Reliance textile group. Although Larsen & Toubro hadn't raised money from the public in 38 years, its new owners frequently raise funds on the local market. (Reliance floated a $357 million petrochemical company in 1988 that was, at the time, the largest public issue in Indian history.)

PENSION AND PROFIT-SHARING RULES: Complying with these is enough to make business owners look forward to their own pension days.

Commodity prices have been rising in recent years, with the farm price index hitting record peaks earlier this year, as the government curtailed production with land-idling programs to reduce price-depressing surpluses. At the same time, export demand for U.S. wheat, corn and other commodities strengthened, said Keith Collins, a department analyst. Farmers also benefited from strong livestock prices, as the nation's cattle inventory dropped close to a 30-year low.

Such moves have helped Mr. Rosen weather the industry slump of recent years. The industry enjoyed six prosperous years beginning in 1980, but since 1986 sales have languished at their $1.8 billion peak. Large furriers such as Antonovich Inc., Fur Vault Inc. and Evans Inc. all reported losses in their latest fiscal years. Aftereffects of the 1987 stock market crash head the list of reasons. In addition, competition has glutted the market with both skins and coats, driving prices down. The animal-rights movement hasn't helped sales. Warm winters over the past two years have trimmed demand, too, furriers complain.

The supply of experienced civil engineers, though, is tighter.

But, after some hesitation, he is back on the stump and also still writing important novels about Peru. “The Storyteller” (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 246 pages, $17.95), splendidly translated by Helen Lane, first appeared in Spanish in 1987 before the Peruvian economy had reached its present state of virtual collapse. And in any case the story takes place a bit earlier than that, when the guerrilla war in the highlands had not yet made internal travel a gamble with destiny. Even still, the very first sentence of this fable that weaves together Peru's most advanced and most primitive cultural strands speaks of “my unfortunate country.” The narrator may be talking about the depredations of the Shining Path Maoists among the Indians of the Andes, or he may be referring to the plunging inti, Peru's rubber currency, or the corrupting effect of the cocaine trade. But he is swiftly drawn into a tangle of memories about a less newsworthy and more exotic part of Peru: its corner of the Amazon jungle.

Despite currency market concerns, analysts stressed that Tokyo market conditions today aren't what they were in 1987. Then, many market watchers in the U.S. worried that the highly speculative Tokyo market would be the one to send world markets reeling. Now, many look to Tokyo as a potential stabilizing factor because of its resilience and quick recovery following Black Monday. Analysts say one point in Tokyo's favor this time is the fact that for the past several weeks the market has been in relatively low gear, driven by fundamental concerns about earnings and interest rates rather than wild speculation. On Friday, the Nikkei index rose 320.97 to close at 35116.02. Trading volume has also fallen off in recent weeks. “A lot of the speculative fat has been trimmed,” said one analyst.

Among other happy news bulletins from the German Democratic Republic, the Leipzig Museum of Fine Arts announced that it has recovered “Cemetery in the Snow,” a painting by the German Romantic painter Caspar David Friedrich. The artist's melancholy subjects bring high prices on the world market, and the U.S. State Department notified IFAR of the theft in February 1988. According to a source at the East Europe desk, two previously convicted felons were charged, tried, convicted and sentenced to prison terms of four and 12 years.

Mr. Sagan compares the importance of Steppenwolf with Orson Welles's Mercury Theater in the '30s. But Welles's theater company turned out to have a brief - one might say a mercurial - existence. What will Mr. Sagan do with his new theater building if the allure of Hollywood and Broadway proves too much for such Steppenwolf stalwarts as John Malkovich (“Dangerous Liaisons”), Joan Allen (“The Heidi Chronicles”), and Glenne Headly (“Lonesome Dove”), and the company crumbles? “That's OK,” Mr. Sagan replies. “Let this building be Steppenwolf's legacy to Chicago theater.”

Factory workers on strike knocked Poland's Communist bosses off balance last year; this year, it was the farmers who brought them down. In June, farmers held onto meat, milk and grain, waiting for July's usual state-directed price rises. The Communists froze prices instead. The farmers ran a boycott, and meat disappeared from the shops. On Aug. 1, the state tore up its controls, and food prices leaped. Without buffer stocks, inflation exploded.

Long-term support for the December contract was believed to be at $1.25 a pound. A technical analyst said there were a number of stop-loss orders under that level that were touched off when the contract's price fell below it. That brought in considerable fund selling, which continued until the close of trading. “In general, it was a bearish close,” said Ben Hanauer, a copper trader at Rudolph Wolff & Co., a major commodities trading and brokerage firm. But whether this price break has implications for this week, he said, “we will know more when the London Metal Exchange copper stock levels are released Monday morning.” Another analyst said he expected LME inventories to be down by about 15,000 tons when the weekly report is issued.

In the hands of a zealot like Lenny Bruce, this double-edged blade could cut both the self and the audience to ribbons. But wielded by a pro like Jackie Mason, it is a constructive form of mischief.

His campaign was caught flat-footed amid allegations it paid almost $10,000 for what it said was a “get-out-the-vote” effort by black activist Sonny Carson, a convicted kidnapper who later said publicly that he is “anti-white.” Critics have said the payment looked like an attempt by the Dinkins camp to get Mr. Carson to stop leading confrontational demonstrations protesting the Bensonhurst murder - protests the campaign may have feared could cause some white voters to turn from a black candidate.

What's more, the corporate borrowing binge hasn't abated in the past two years. “We've had two more years of significant accumulation of debt ... just at the time when earnings are being squeezed,” Mr. Chimerine notes.

A company with a strong balance sheet can withstand an unanticipated storm; a highly leveraged company may end up in bankruptcy court.

Mr. Baker seems especially sensitive to the Washington ailment known as Beltway-itis. Its symptoms include a cold sweat at the sound of debate, clammy hands in the face of congressional criticism, and fainting spells when someone writes the word “controversy.” As one unidentified official clearly in the late stages of the disease told the Times: “Baker just felt that there were some lines in the speech that could be misinterpreted and seized by the press.” In short, the problem is not intra-administration disagreement, but preoccupation with the prospect that perestrokia might fail, and its political opponents will ask “Who lost Gorbachev?”

“We were concerned that they weren't going to generate enough cash for capital spending and also to pay down debt,” says a big investor in high-yield debt. DLJ argues that TW could, if necessary, cut capital spending, since half of what it plans to spend is for “growth,” rather than maintenance. But investors noted that under the shelved offering, TW would have needed to grow to meet its debt payments. Its calculations for meeting cash charges ignore $52 million a year in interest on cash-deferred, or zero-coupon debentures - which ultimately would have had to be paid.

We know Verdi's own contribution was mighty impressive since the operatic “Libera me” was reworked for the Manzoni Requiem, of which he wrote every note himself having learned his lesson. The surprising discovery of the evening at Fisher was the high standard achieved by some of his now-obscure colleagues, notably Raimondo Boucheron. His melodious “Confutatis” was smoothly sung by bass Brian Matthews. Also, Teodulo Mabellini's “Lux aeterna” was intriguingly scored and splendidly put across by Mr. Rilling. He brought along his Stuttgart-based Gaechinger Kantorei chorus, and even better, the Czech soprano Gabriela Benackova. She was in her most radiant, expressive voice. Maybe she could step across the plaza to the Met - where she has still to make her debut - and help out her Czech compatriot by singing the slow parts of “Traviata.”

The unifying bond for this left-right mismatch was plain: PASOK (Mr. Papandreou's party) as common political enemy. The ostensible goal was a mop-up of government corruption, purportedly at all levels, but the main marks were Mr. Papandreou and his closest associates. In point of fact, this catharsis was overdue by decades. When reduced to buzzword status in ex parte pledges, however, the notion transmogrified into a promised assault, with targets primarily for political gains, not justice.

In particular, they said, firms such as First Boston Corp. and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. began making a market in junk issues early in the session when prices hit severely depressed levels.

Warner obviously doesn't think that it is in its own interests to let Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters go off to Columbia. At the very least, Mr. Ross clearly sees an opportunity to use the two men to get a pound of flesh from Sony. During settlement talks, for example, Warner demanded such things as cable TV rights to Columbia movies and Columbia's interest in the studio it jointly owns with Warner, according to executives involved in the talks. In any settlement, Warner is almost certain to demand rights to most of the 50 or so projects Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters have locked up for the next few years, notably sequels to “Batman.”

The plant in Leominster is the first of five planned by the National Polystyrene Recycling Co., the plastics-industry joint venture. It was formed earlier this year by Dow Chemical Co., Mobil Corp. and six other concerns in response to concerns about growing amounts of non-biodegradable plastic trash. Paul Keough, acting regional director for the Environmental Protection Agency in Boston, said, “We hope that other large companies follow McDonald's lead to undertake similar programs.” But Amy Perry, a spokeswoman for the Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group, a Boston offshoot of Ralph Nader's lobbying outfits, argued that the program “just serves to legitimize increasing the use of throwaway plastics. It would be far better for McDonald's to use durable goods {that could be reused for serving food}, instead of promoting the throwaway society.”

Like the bacteria used by genetic engineers, the yeast can take in human genes and churn out human proteins for medical use. But the yeast genetic apparatus is more like that of animals than the bacterial genetic apparatus. Thus, the proteins from the yeast are molecularly more like human proteins than those from bacteria.

In this respect, it would be helpful if our political leaders were mute, rather than eloquently “concerned.” They are inevitably inclined to echo the conventional pap, since this is the least controversial option that is open to them. Thus at the recent governors' conference on education, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas announced that “this country needs a comprehensive child-development policy for children under five.” A comprehensive development policy for governors over 30 would seem to be a more pressing need. What Gov. Clinton is advocating, in effect, is extending the educational system down to the pre-kindergarten years. Whether desirable or not, this is a child-care program, not an educational program. We know that very early exposure to schooling improves performance in the first grade, but afterward the difference is quickly washed away.

It might be feared that even thinking about lower budgets will hurt national security because the door will be opened to opportunistic budget cutting by an irresponsible Congress. This argument plays well in the atmosphere of gaming and mistrust permeating the Pentagon and Congress, and unfortunately, there is some truth to it. But in the end, it must be rejected for logical as well as moral reasons. To say that the Pentagon should act irresponsibly because acting responsibly will provoke Congress into acting irresponsibly leads to the conclusion that the Pentagon should deliberately exaggerate its needs in the national interest; in other words, that it is justified in committing a crime - lying to Congress - because it is morally superior.

All the tie-ins, though, have some marketing experts questioning whether the party may go too far. “There are too many people participating,” says Al Ries, of Trout & Ries, a Greenwich, Conn., marketing consulting firm. “If you want to cut through the clutter, you have to make your message as distinct, sharp and individual as possible. Sharing a character with other advertisers isn't a way to do that.”

Besides the troubles at Douglas - which continued to be plagued by high development costs on the new MD-11 tri-jet and parts shortages - McDonnell Douglas's combat aircraft segment also had its difficulties. Profits for the division tumbled to $67 million from $91 million, primarily because of reduced earnings for its AH-64 Apache helicopter and write-downs on several other helicopter programs. These more than offset an improved financial performance by the F-15 fighter. Earnings were also off 33% in the missiles, space and electronic-systems segment, despite a 13% rise in revenue. Mr. Modzelewski, while noting that times are tough for arms makers, said he expected McDonnell Douglas's Pentagon-related projects to “bounce back next quarter” to some degree. A number of defense-oriented aerospace companies, including Northrop Corp. and General Dynamics Corp., have reported either flat or lower third-quarter earnings.

With a Qintex deal, NBC would move into uncharted territory - possibly raising hackles at the studios and in Washington.

Many of Canada's oil and gas producers say the outlook for natural gas is better than it is for oil, and have shifted their exploration and development budgets accordingly. The number of active drilling rigs in Canada is down 30% from a year ago, and the number of completed oil wells is “down more than that, due to the increasing focus on gas exploration,” said Robert Feick, manager of crude oil with Calgary's Independent Petroleum Association of Canada, an industry group.

Douglas Jones, an attorney representing Richard O.

Traditionally, boiler rooms operate on the cheap, since few, if any, customers ever visit their offices. Indeed, the name derives from the tendency among telemarketing scammers to rent cheap basement space, near the boiler room.

These campaign problems have echoed difficulties Mr. Dinkins has run into before.

But his chance to become deputy mayor under Mayor Abraham Beame, a plan boosted by Mr. Sutton, was squandered because of Mr. Dinkins's failure - still largely unexplained - to file income tax returns for four years running. “I always thought of this as a thing that could always be done tomorrow,” he said at the time.

Packages encourage loyalty by rewarding customers for doing the bulk of their banking in one place. For their troubles, the banks get a larger captive audience that is less likely to move at the drop of a rate.

“I like to succeed,” says Mr. Rey during a recent morning of working at home, which he also likes. Home is an estate with green meadows opening onto Lake Geneva and a low-slung house whose rooms overlook the water and offer a view of the French Alps. In the corner of his reception room is a delicate antique desk piled high with dossiers. There is a small Renoir on the wall. Zurich-based magazine Bilanz lists Mr. Rey as having a fortune of about 1.5 billion Swiss francs. Writes Bilanz: “No one in Switzerland ever came so far so fast ... He was simply the first in this country to realize that treasures were just lying around waiting to be picked up. In short: Rey found companies with weak earnings but rich assets.”
