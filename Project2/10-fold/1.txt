The potential is displayed along every road into Warsaw: row upon row of greenhouses, stretching out behind modern mansions that trumpet their owners' wealth. Vegetables are abundant and full of flavor in Poland, the pickles and sauerkraut sublime, the state monopolies long broken. Grain, milk and meat come next.

A Chinese official harshly criticized plans to close a British naval base in downtown Hong Kong. Hong Kong officials announced last week that the base will be relocated to a small island to allow downtown redevelopment. But Beijing wants to use the base for the People's Liberation Army after 1997, when the territory returns to Chinese sovereignty. Ke Zaishuo, head of China's delegation to a Chinese-British Liaison Committee on Hong Kong, accused Britain of trying to impose a fait accompli and said, “This is something we can not accept.”

While they don't expect the Fed to move right away, they say the case for lower rates is building.

Many investors wrote asking the SEC to require insiders to report their purchases and sales immediately, not a month later.

Emigration applications soared in 1985, when Britain and China ratified their accord on Hong Kong's future. In 1987, Hong Kong's most prosperous year for a decade, 30,000 left, up 58% from the previous year. Last year, 45,000 went. The government predicts that annual outflows will level off over the next few years at as much as 60,000 - a projection that is widely regarded as unrealistically low. A large number of those leaving are managers and professionals. While no one professes to know the exact cost of such a “brain drain” to the economy, hardly anyone doubts that it poses a threat.

Although sports officials predict jumps of 50% to 100% in the major contracts coming up for renewal, ad rates may rise only 20%. CBS hopes to save money by ordering fewer episodes of regular series because sports will fill up a few weeks of prime time. But the savings will be minuscule. Each hour of Olympics and baseball in prime time will cost CBS $2.6 million to $2.8 million; an hour-long drama costs only $900,000, and it is aired twice.

In a statement that was as close as East Germany gets to practicing “glasnost”, Otto Reinhold, an East German party theorist, actually acknowledged the reunification dilemma. “The main problem,” Mr. Reinhold said in an East German radio interview monitored by Radio Free Europe in Munich, stems from the fact that “the GDR is different” from other East European states. “What kind of right to exist,” he asked, “would a capitalist German Democratic Republic have alongside a capitalist Federal Republic?” That's a question East Germany can't answer easily, no matter what its new leader does.

IN WHAT MAY SIGNAL a turnaround for asbestos manufacturers, W.R. Grace & Co. won a 3 1\/2-week trial in Pittsburgh over whether it should be required to remove asbestos fireproofing from a local high school. Mount Lebanon High School, near Pittsburgh, sought $21 million in compensatory damages from Grace, arguing that the asbestos, which can cause respiratory diseases and lung cancer, posed a risk to students. Grace successfully contended that removing the fire retardant would pose a greater health risk than leaving it alone. A spokesman for the company said the verdict is thought to be the first in favor of an asbestos manufacturer where the plaintiff was a school and the asbestos in question was used for fireproofing.

Sales growth in the quarter was slowed by mounting pressure from groups of buyers, such as hospitals, to hold down prices. Suppliers were also hurt by the stronger U.S. dollar, which makes sales abroad more difficult. In some cases, competition has squeezed margins. Becton, Dickinson & Co., for example, faces stiff competition from a Japanese supplier in the important syringe market. The Franklin Lakes, N.J., company is expected to report sales growth of only 5% to 6%, but should still maintain earnings growth of 10%, says Jerry E. Fuller, an analyst with Duff & Phelps Inc.

Many states already have Enterprise Zones and legislation that combines tax incentives, loans, and grants to encourage investment in depressed areas with requirements for the hiring of the unemployed and minorities. These programs could be expanded to focus on funds for project planning, identifying sources of funds, and for acquiring a site and preparing it. Combatting crime and the fear of it in inner-city commercial areas should give Enterprise Zones more success than most have enjoyed to date.

The relationship between surface release of CFCs and global stratospheric ozone loss was identified back in 1974. Although, like all scientific theories, it had its initial opponents, few experts question the connection now.

Even though electronic espionage may cost U.S. firms billions of dollars a year, most aren't yet taking precautions, the experts said. By contrast, European firms will spend $150 million this year on electronic security, and are expected to spend $1 billion by 1992. Already many foreign firms, especially banks, have their own cryptographers, conference speakers reported. Still, encrypting corporate communications is only a partial remedy. One expert, whose job is so politically sensitive that he spoke on condition that he wouldn't be named or quoted, said the expected influx of East European refugees over the next few years will greatly increase the chances of computer-maintenance workers, for example, doubling as foreign spies.

Longer term, the impact is unclear. The change prompted the rise of discount brokers and a reduction in securities research firms. But there are currently more exchange members than in 1975, with the bigger houses gaining a larger share of total commissions.

This wage inflation is bleeding the NFL dry, the owners contend. Soon, only large corporations will be able to afford to buy and run football teams, predicts John J.

Details of the plan, which would go into effect in 1993, are sketchy, but each player would apparently be paid a base salary keyed to his position and ability. Bonuses would be paid based on playing time and performance.

Joseph Lombardo, who the government alleged was the “captain” of organized crime in Chicago, was one of numerous defendants in the government's sweeping racketeering suit against the Teamsters. In the suit, filed in June 1988, the government accused the union's leadership of depriving its 1.6 million members of their rights through a pattern of racketeering. Among other things, the government claimed that organized crime figures had routinely handpicked the union's top officials.

What is of much more importance to the Colombian economy than the supposed benefits of laundered drug money is higher prices for Colombia's legitimate products. The price of coffee has gone down almost 45% since the beginning of the year, to the lowest level (after inflation) since the Great Depression. Market conditions point to even lower prices next year. The 27-year-old coffee cartel had to be formally dissolved this summer. As a result, Colombia will earn $500 million less from its coffee this year than last. Our coffee growers face reductions in their income, and this tempts them to contemplate substituting coca crops for coffee.

On the other hand, one reason those ratios were so high in 1987 was that the stock market had been anticipating an enormous rise in corporate earnings, which did in fact occur. Between 1987 and 1989, those profits were projected to rise by 50%. But now those earnings are hitting a plateau. Just last week a string of earnings disappointments unnerved some market participants. Next year, earnings are expected to inch up only 2.4%.

My revolutionary system is also useful for those who have tried customary forms of growing their currency cushion.

Fees paid to the banks, set at about 1.5% of loans, are low compared with other buy-outs, which have paid 2% to 2.5%. Because buy-out loans often get refinanced - and thus paid off - ahead of schedule, banks can't count on years of interest income from these loans. They like deals to be “front-loaded” with fees.

Critics of the present arrangement are correct to say that it is undemocratic. What is undemocratic is the unwillingness of the more political parts of the government to take the responsibility for deciding the basic question of monetary policy, which is what priority should be given to stabilizing the price level. To leave this decision to an “independent” agency is not only undemocratic. It also prevents the conduct of a policy that has a long-term rationale, because it leaves the Fed guessing about what are the expectations of its masters, the politicians, who have never had to consider the long-term consequences of monetary policy.

Faced with another Mr. Honecker, so many despairing East Germans are likely to flee that the two German peoples will get their reunification, de facto, on West German ground. But if East Germany's arthritic Politburo does loosen up enough to permit Mr. Krenz to make serious efforts at reform, he will face a challenge just as fundamental. Abandoning socialism means abandoning the East German state's reason for existence, and with it the justification for its watchdogs and its Wall. In this scenario it's hard to imagine that a pale imitation of the Federal Republic could avoid being pulled into some kind of tie - economic, federal or stronger - with West Germany.

HOUSTON-CALGARY ALLIANCE: Fulbright & Jaworski of Houston and Fenerty, Robertson, Fraser & Hatch of Calgary, Alberta, are affiliating to help serve their energy-industry clients. The affiliation is believed to be the first such cross-border arrangement among major law firms. The firms aren't required to refer work exclusively to each other and remain separate organizations. But they will work together on energy -, environmental - and fair-trade-related issues and conduct seminars on topics of mutual interest, said Gibson Gayle Jr. of 585-lawyer Fulbright & Jaworski. In addition, Fulbright & Jaworski's Washington, D.C., office will play a key role as the firms work together on regulatory issues, particularly natural-gas exports, for their clients. The arrangement, reached after about eight months of negotiations, grew out of 80-lawyer Fenerty Robertson's desire to develop ties with a U.S. firm in light of relaxed trade barriers between the U.S. and Canada, said Francis M. Saville of Fenerty Robertson.

Had the futures and options markets been open, additional liquidity would have been provided and the decline, most probably, would have been less intense. At 3:30, after intense telephone negotiations between the trading markets and Washington, the futures exchanges reopened.

The bad news, however, hasn't been bad enough to kill the growing demand for financial planning. The Tax Reform Act of 1986, which eliminated many tax shelters peddled by planners, and the stock market crash the next year did cause a sharp slump in such demand, and many planners had to make an unplanned exit from the business. But membership in the International Association of Financial Planners (IAFP), the industry's biggest trade group, is still nearly triple what it was in 1980, and it's believed that the ranks of planners who don't belong to any group have soared as well.

At the same time, abortion foes have developed a national legislative strategy, deciding to move on what Jacki Ragan, the National Right to Life Committee's director of state organizational development, calls “reasonable measures that an overwhelming mainstream majority of Americans support.” These include bans on the use of abortion for birth control and sex selection, and the public funding of alternatives for abortion. “Those who are on the other side can hardly oppose alternative funding if they continue to insist on calling themselves “pro-choice” rather than “pro-abortion,”” says Mary Spaulding, the group's associate state legislative coordinator.

At the center of any court fight will be the differing interpretations of the written contract between Warner and the two producers, but other murkier issues will play a big role.

The trust also will receive $75 million a year starting in 1991 on a bond it holds from Manville. And, beginning in 1992, it will have a claim on as much as 20% of Manville's annual net income. Even so, the trust would seem to be facing a cash crunch. As of June 30, it had settled only about 15,000 of the 81,000 received claims from asbestos victims, for an average of $40,424 each. (The average should drop over time, since the most expensive claims are being settled first). And as of midyear, settled but unpaid claims amounted to $136 million - more than half the trust's total of $268 million in cash and marketable securities. “At some point, we're going to need an infusion of funds,” a person close to the trust says.

Compounding the trouble to Japanese investors, mortgage securities pay interest monthly, since most mortgages require homeowners to make monthly payments.

The Old Crowd is deeply concerned by the backlash from all this. However, the phenomenon is not specifically Jewish. It has always been true that those outside the club want to climb in, and that a few will cut corners in the process. Some pretty seamy stuff built the turn-of-the-century families' Fifth Avenue and Newport palazzi and endowed their daughters' weddings to foreign noblemen. Mr. Boesky was a piker compared to Jay Gould and Jim Fiske, and Commodore Vanderbilt thought nothing of bribing judges and legislators. So who knows? In a generation or two some of the New Crowd may attain true respectability, perhaps to be displaced in turn by a later flock of unscrupulous raptors. Or perhaps Wall Street, when it has suffered enough, will realize that finance is a service industry, and change its ethos.

An alternative and more convincing explanation, confirmed by recent events and a close inspection of the Gorbachev program, is that the new Soviet economic and social structures are intended to conform to a model other than that of the market. For example, while the laws on individual labor activity allow a citizen to earn a living independent of the state, strict provisions are attached on how far this may lead to the development of a free market. Before becoming self-employed, or setting up a cooperative, workers must seek permission from the local soviet (council). Permission is far from automatic: The soviets have the legal right to turn down applications and impose conditions, and they appear to be exercising these powers. Private dressmaking, for example, is allowed in 10 Soviet republics but banned by five; shoemaking is allowed in seven but illegal in nine.

One team at the Federal Express Ground Operations station in Natick, Mass., focused on a particularly time-sensitive operation: the morning package sort. Every morning, tractor-trailer trucks arrive at the Natick Ground Station from Boston's Logan Airport, carrying the day's package load. In peak periods that load may include 4,000 pieces. The packages must be sorted quickly and distributed to smaller vans for delivery, so couriers can be on the road by 8:35. No customer is present at the morning package sort, but the process is nevertheless critical to customer satisfaction.

The new Hewlett-Packard program, said analyst John McCarthy at Forrester Research Inc., a computer-market research company, “is a key building block as people move to this new model of distributed processing.” In today's computer networks, some machines often sit idle while others are overtaxed. With the Hewlett-Packard program, he said, “You get more bang for the buck you've spent on computers.”

In contrast to the 1% conversion fee charged by Visa, foreign-currency dealers routinely charge 7% or more to convert U.S. dollars into foreign currency.

Anthony Broderick, the FAA's acting executive director for regulatory standards and compliance, contends that the current rule is the best approach because it allows parents to make their own decision on whether to use a safety seat.

(Most airlines don't prohibit their use.) He says the agency also will seek public comment on whether the seats should be required.

The graph on the left shows how this happens (see accompanying illustration - WSJ Oct. 30, 1989). Compare the past eight five-year plans with actual appropriations. The Pentagon's strategists produce budgets that simply can not be executed because they assume a defense strategy depends only on goals and threats. Strategy, however, is about possibilities, not hopes and dreams. By ignoring costs, U.S. strategists abdicate their responsibility for hard decisions. That puts the real strategic decisions in the hands of others: bean counters, budgeteers, and pork-barrelers. These people have different agendas. And as a result - as the recent vote by the House to undo Mr. Cheney's program terminations suggests - the preservation of jobs is becoming the real goal of defense “strategy.”

The federal productivity estimators use labor input, rather than output, data for their calculations of half of private financial and service industries as well. Independent estimates of output in those industries, including one by the Department of Labor for banking, suggests that productivity in finance and services appears to have risen by an average of at least 1.5% a year between 1948 and 1988. Because finance and services contribute 10% to final business product, missing these productivity improvements depresses the overall growth rate by 0.15% a year.

The Soviet Union should keep these lessons in mind as it seeks to establish the ruble as an international currency. One way to make the ruble into a major international currency would be to leave reserves of gold and earning assets in a Swiss bank with distributions based on Swiss laws. Unless the laws determining the noteholder's rights to payment are independent of the issuer of those notes, however, a gold-based ruble would be as unsuccessful for the Soviets as it was for the czars.

The key to Pinkerton's future will be sticking to what it does best - being a security company, says Mr. Wathen. The company is also renewing its emphasis on investigations, particularly undercover investigations for corporations. Although investigations now account for only about 5% of Pinkerton's total revenue, that side of the business has traditionally been the more “glamorous” of the two and it carries historical and sentimental value. (Author Dashiell Hammett, who wrote “The Maltese Falcon,” was a former Pinkerton's detective.)

Maybe he didn't start it, but Mohandas Gandhi certainly provided a recognizable beginning to non-violent civil disobedience as we know it today. The Mahatma, or “great souled one,” instigated several campaigns of passive resistance against the British government in India. Unfortunately, according to Webster's Biographical Dictionary, “His policies went beyond his control and resulted ... in riots and disturbances” and later a renewed campaign of civil disobedience “resulted in rioting and a second imprisonment.” I am not a proponent of everything Gandhi did, but some of his law breaking was justified because India was then under occupation by a foreign power, and Indians were not able to participate fully in decisions that vitally affected them.

I believe any physician who truly cares about cancer patients, both today and tomorrow, should offer the hope of something better than that. My statement, read verbatim from a printed text available to all reporters attending the National Cancer Institute news conference, was the following: “New clinical trials are already in operation seeking to improve these results. These research protocols offer to the patient not only the very best therapy which we have established today but also the hope of something still better. I feel any patient with high-risk cancer is getting short shrift if he is not offered this opportunity.”

For Carat, meanwhile, the alliance with Eurocom and WCRS is intended to strengthen its own push outside France. Carat's Gross brothers invented the idea of large-scale buying of media space. By buying the space in bulk, they obtain discounts as high as 50%, which they can pass on to customers. They thus have won the French space-buying business of such advertising giants as Coca-Cola Co., Fiat S.p. A., Gillette and Kodak.

That sort of approach, however, hasn't worked since the addition of Tiger. Its 6,500 workers, who had battled Tiger's management for years over givebacks, were union members until the day of the merger, when most of their unions were automatically decertified. Soon after the merger, moreover, Federal's management asked Tiger's pilots to sign an agreement stating that they could be fired any time, without cause or notice. When the pilots refused, the company retracted it.

Mr. Greenspan's decision to keep quiet also prompted a near-mutiny within the Fed's ranks. A “senior Fed official” spoke on Saturday after the market swoon to both the Washington Post and the New York Times, saying the Fed was prepared to provide as much credit as the markets needed. The statement angered Chairman Greenspan, but it was greeted with applause by the Bush administration and the financial markets. And, while the mutinous Fed member hasn't gone public, some Fed governors, most notably Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson, are known to have disagreed with the chairman's decision to remain silent. Ironically, the anonymous official's comments have earned some plaudits for Mr. Greenspan, who is mistakenly seen as the source. At a hearing last week, Democratic Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut told Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady that “Chairman Greenspan's” announcement over the Oct. 13 weekend was a “very important statement.” Mr. Brady hesitantly replied that he wasn't sure whether Mr. Greenspan “made a statement himself, or whether that was a newspaper report.”

Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. - $200 million of stripped mortgage securities underwritten by BT Securities Corp. The agency's first strips issue, collateralized by Freddie Mac 8% securities pooled into a single security called a Giant, will be divided into interest-only and principal-only securities. The collateral is being sold by a thrift institution. The principal-only securities will be repackaged by BT Securities into a Freddie Mac Remic, Series 103, that will have six classes. The interest-only securities will be sold separately by BT Securities. The principal-only securities pay the principal from the underlying Freddie Mac 8% securities, while the interest-only securities pay only interest. Freddie Mac said the principal-only securities were priced at 58 1\/4 to yield 8.45%, assuming an average life of eight years and a prepayment of 160% of the PSA model. The interest-only securities were priced at 35 1\/2 to yield 10.72%.

“The New Crowd” by Judith Ramsey Ehrlich and Barry J. Rehfeld (Little, Brown, 444 pages, $19.95), describes the displacing of the old “our crowd” Jewish Wall Street banking grandees by such new business barons as Saul Steinberg, Carl Icahn, Sanford Weill and Bruce Wasserstein. Its many lively stories include the Gutfreund-Postel holiday cheer imbroglio. These two New Crowd families lived in the same apartment building, with the Postel penthouse perched on top of the Gutfreund duplex. The penthouse elevator started up from the Gutfreund landing, and Susan Gutfreund used to turn off its light, to give the impression that there was no higher floor. Eventually, Mr. Postel broke his toe in the dark.

The junk market, which mushroomed to $200 billion from less than $2 billion at the start of the decade, has been declining for months as issuers have stumbled under the weight of hefty interest payments. The fragile market received its biggest jolt last month from Campeau Corp., which created its U.S. retailing empire with more than $3 billion in junk financing. Campeau developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be tardy on some interest payments and to put its prestigious Bloomingdale's department store chain up for sale. At that point, the junk market went into a tailspin as buyers disappeared and investors tried to sell.

At least once Mancuso's boss yells “In here - now,” and proceeds to dress his investigator down: “You are a dinosaur ... a hangover in a $10 suit ...

A black-draped cruise liner sailed into Naples yesterday bringing 800 Libyans threatening vengeance if Italy refuses to pay compensation for more than 30 years of colonial rule. Another 250 Libyans were already in Italy to stage a day of mourning for victims of Italy's colonial rule between 1911 and 1943, when Tripoli says Rome kidnapped 5,000 Libyans and deported them as forced labor. Libya's revolutionary Committees have threatened attacks on Italians if Rome doesn't pay compensation. But officials in Rome say the issue was legally resolved by a settlement between Italy and King Idris, deposed by Col. Muammar Gadhafi in 1969.

Then there is the artifical sea wall, 600 yards long and 60 yards thick, jutting into the ocean. Made of sand, it receives around-the-clock maintainence against the battering waves. When the mining in front of the wall is complete, it is moved northward. A companion jetty that helps hold back the sea looks like a rusting junkyard. Engineers first used concrete blocks to bolster the barrier, but the ocean tossed them aside like driftwood. Then someone decided to try broken-down earthmoving equipment that, inexplicably, held against the waves.

The eucalyptus plantation and pulp mill, which would have covered about 175,000 acres in the Irian Jaya region, had been approved by Indonesia's investment board.

SUGAR: World prices tumbled, mostly from their own weight, according to analysts. The March contract ended at 13.79 cents a pound, down 0.37 cent. For the past week or so, traders have been expecting India to buy between 150,000 and 200,000 tons of refined sugar, and there have been expectations of a major purchase by Japan. But with no reports of either country actually entering the market, analysts said, futures prices became vulnerable. Developing countries such as India, some analysts said, seem to have made it a point to stay away whenever sugar reached the top of its trading range, around 14.75 cents, and wait for prices to return to the bottom of the range, around 13.50 cents. But Erik Dunlaevy, a sugar analyst with Balfour Maclaine International Ltd., said the explanation for the latest drop in sugar prices is much simpler: Speculators, he said, “got too long too soon and ran into resistance around the old contract highs.” A PaineWebber analyst said that in light of a new estimate of a production increase of four million metric tons and only a modest increase in consumption, sugar isn't likely to rise above the top of its trading range without a crop problem in a major producing country.

This time, the scandal centers on donations made by the not-quite-mainstream pachinko parlor industry. Pachinko, a kind of pinball, is Japan's favorite form of legal gambling. The donations so far appear to be small, especially compared with the huge sums that changed hands in the Recruit Co. influence-peddling scandal that plagued the ruling party last year. But the implications could be great.

I don't want to feel guilty representing my constituents.

Yet the Soviet leader's readiness to embark on foreign visits and steady accumulation of personal power, particularly since the last Politburo reshuffle on Sept. 30, do not suggest that Mr. Gorbachev is on the verge of being toppled; nor does he look likely to reverse the powers of perestroika. Indeed, the Soviet miners strike this summer clearly demonstrated that Mr. Gorbachev must proceed with economic reform.

- Privatization. Faced with a $40 billion foreign debt and skyrocketing inflation, Poland must privatize industry and eliminate subsidies to stabilize its currency and qualify for international assistance. Market-based pollution control may consume some capital that would otherwise purchase state industries. But it could also accelerate “marketization” by reinforcing industrial accountability, breaking up state monopolies, giving managers a stake in solutions, and ensuring that modernization is not reversible for failure to address environmental effects.

The British satirical magazine Private Eye won an appeal against the size of a $960,000 libel award to Sonia Sutcliffe, the estranged wife of the “Yorkshire Ripper” mass murderer. An appeals-court panel slashed all but $40,000 from the award, the largest ever set by a British jury, pending a reassessment of the damages. But the panel dismissed the magazine's contention that it hadn't libeled Mrs. Sutcliffe when it accused her of trying to sell her story to capitalize on the notoriety of her husband. Private Eye had been threatened with closure because it couldn't afford the libel payment.

More and more observers now realize that the key to ending future HUD scandals lies in forcing Congress to clean up its own act. This week, a Baltimore Sun editorial said the Lantos subcommittee on HUD should forget about Sam Pierce's testimony for the moment and call some other witnesses: the various congressional sponsors of the 40 pork-barrel projects. The Sun concluded that Mr. Pierce is only part of the problem - and a part that's gone. “If HUD is to be reformed,” it concluded, Members of Congress will “have to start looking into, and doing something about, the practices of their colleagues.”

Industry executives said Philip Morris had asked the other agencies to create campaigns in a bid to stop the brand's slipping market share. According to John Maxwell, an analyst at Wheat First Securities, Richmond, Va., Benson & Hedges has slipped from 4.7% of the cigarette market in 1985 to just 4.1% after the second quarter of this year. The brand is No. 7 overall in the cigarette business, Mr. Maxwell said. The slip has come despite high-profile ads created by Wells Rich, including one picturing a young man clad only in pajama bottoms interrupting a festive brunch. That ad generated so much publicity that a trade magazine launched a contest for its readers to guess who the guy was and what he was doing.

The individual foreign policy carried out by U.S. legislators adds to a confusing U.S. performance that has emboldened Soviet initiatives in Central America. On Oct. 3, following conversations with Secretary of State James Baker, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze arrived in Managua to acclaim “Nicaragua's great peace efforts.” There, Mr. Shevardnadze felt legitimized to unveil his own peace plan: The U.S.S.R. would prolong a suspension of arms shipments to Nicaragua after the February election if the U.S. did likewise with its allies in Central America. He also called on Nicaragua's neighbors to accept a “military equilibrium” guaranteed by both superpowers. The Pentagon claims that in spite of Moscow's words, East bloc weapons continue to flow into Nicaragua through Cuba at near-record levels.

In the Senate, Majority Whip Alan Cranston used his position to win not only the expanded credit but also more generous treatment than the House had permitted in the distribution of highway funds in the next six months. The emergency assistance wouldn't be counted against a state's normal allocation of annual highway funds, and the bill circumvents existing restrictions that otherwise would prevent the use of federal aid to repair a toll road, such as the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge damaged in last week's earthquake.

These are curious times in South African politics. The government and the ANC, the bitterest of enemies, are engaged in an elaborate mating dance designed to entice each other to the negotiating table. Pretoria releases the ANC leaders, most of whom were serving life sentences, and allows them to speak freely, hoping that the ANC will abandon its use of violence. The ANC leaders speak in tones of moderation, emphasizing discipline, hoping the government will be encouraged to take further steps, such as freeing Nelson Mandela, the most prominent ANC figure, and unbanning the organization.

On Saturday night, quite a few of the boys in green and gold salted away successes to salve the pain of past and, no doubt, future droughts. Mark McGwire, the big, red-haired Oakland first baseman, had three hits in four at bats, two more than he'd had in the five-game Dodger series in which he'd gone 1-for-17. The A-men batting Nos. 6 through 9, a.k.a. the “bottom of the order,” got seven of their team's 11 hits and scored four of its runs in a 5-0 decision.

Even in the short run, the investment boom could exacerbate a disturbing trend: Japanese exports are showing surprisingly little tendency to ease. Japanese auto makers, for example, are increasing their production capacity in the U.S.; the additional production should, in part, replace imported vehicles with locally manufactured ones. But although Japanese companies increased their U.S. auto output by 42% from January to September compared with the year-earlier period, their exports to the U.S. will drop only 9% this year, Nikko Research Center estimates.

DIALING DOLLARS: Small businesses in suburban Chicago are discovering that an area-code switch Nov. 11 - to 708 from the familiar 312 - won't be without some costs as they alter stationery, among other things, and notify customers. Wessels & Pautsch, a small St. Charles law firm, plans to mail 500 customers a list of its lawyers' new phone and fax numbers as well as updated Rolodex cards. But many owners plan to practice frugality - crossing out the old code and writing in the new one until their stock runs out. Even print-shop operator Clay Smith of Naperville won't discard his old supply. (He reports his business is up slightly from customers replacing old stock.)

The junk-mail titans, ever optimistic, are looking for ways around the problem. So far, they say, it hasn't had any noticeable effect on response rates. And before it does, they're trying to cut back on the clutter that created the situation in the first place. Among other things, the industry is trying to come up with standardized business lists that cut down on duplications. “We're going to have to mail a lot less and a lot smarter,” says Jack Miller, president of Quill Corp., a Lincolnshire, Ill., business-to-business mail-order company.

- PRICES. The entire system of centrally set prices would be overhauled, and free-market prices introduced for most wholesale trade and some retail trade. Consumers would still be able to buy some food and household goods at subsidized prices, but luxury and imported items, including food, would be sold at market prices. Wholesale prices would be divided into three categories: raw materials sold at fixed prices close to world levels; government-set procurement prices for a small number of key products; and free prices for everything else to be determined by contracts between suppliers and purchasers. Inflation-adjusted social benefits would ensure that the poor and elderly don't suffer unduly.

We suspect Daniel Ortega knows the difference between a blunder and a strategy. He knows that making George Bush look silly in a photograph with him will trigger Noriegan fulminations, and that announcing an end to the liberals' cease-fire will produce mainly their concern over the Contras' military activities in northern Nicaragua. Mr. Ortega understands better than those who worry about his behavior that what sustains the Sandinista movement is not democratic peace, but nondemocratic unpeace. It is the presence of internal and external “enemies” which justifies the need for a large, active army that Mikhail Gorbachev's Soviet Union continues to supply with bullets.

If a veto is unworkable because it would leave part of the executive branch unfunded, the president could sign the appropriations bills into law and assert a power of excision, declaring the rider restricting his Article II powers to be unconstitutional and severable.

As the story of “Mastergate” unfolds, we learn that the Internal Revenue Service confiscated one of the properties of a foreign financier who owes the government millions in taxes. The man, it seems, has a Lichtenstein corporation, licensed in Libya and sheltered in the Bahamas. He himself lives in a “consecutive series of unnumbered houses in a town in Switzerland.” The property seized by the IRS is a Hollywood film studio, Master Pictures Incorporated (MPI). Supposedly the IRS will sell off the assets of MPI, but before it can, a lowly IRS agent is called into the hospital room of Wylie Slaughter, the dying head of the Central Intelligence Agency.

Let me immediately put limits to whatever nostalgic notions that may intimate. Those “people” to whom I refer are not some heroic, indecipherable quantity; they are artists, critics, taxi drivers, grandmothers, even some employees of the Ministry of Culture, all of whom share a deep belief in the original principles of the Cuban Revolution, spelled out in terms such as equality among all members of the society, reverence for education and creative expression, universal rights to health and livelihood, housing, etc. In fact, the generation of painters growing into maturity right now works with such profoundly held humanist assumptions and such passionate commitment to moral and ethical principles that it makes Che Guevara's famous linkages of art, idealism and revolution seem modest. It is on behalf of these people, and out of my real respect for them, that I am responding to Mr. Asman's opinions of their country.

In making polyethylene sheets out of plastic chips, for instance, a chip sometimes doesn't melt, gets caught in the machinery and creates a run in the sheets. That can be expensive, because the problem may not be noticed for a while, and the sheets are typically thrown away. But Mr. Keller said that, if computers can be integrated into the process, they could alert an operator as soon as the problem occurred. They could also check through the orders on file to find a customer that was willing to accept a lower grade of polyethylene. The computer would let the machine run just until that order was filled, eliminating waste.

None of the problems is necessarily fatal, and they aren't all necessarily even related. There are also other factors at work that are outside IBM's control, such as currency exchange rates.

That means that a corporation, after a specified amount of time has passed, can buy back its bonds by paying investors the face value (plus, in some cases, a sweetener). When interest rates have dropped, it makes sense for corporations to do just that; they then save on interest costs. But the investors are left stranded with money to reinvest at a time when interest rates are puny.

If Mr. Mason had used less derogatory language to articulate his amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow New Yorkers, would the water be quite so hot?

In Japan, “software is four to five years behind the U.S. because hardware is four to five years behind, because NEC is enjoying a monopoly,” complains Kazuhiko Nishi, the president of Ascii Corp., one of Japan's leading PC-magazine publishing and software companies. “There are no price wars, no competition.” An NEC spokeswoman responds that prices are higher in Japan because customers put a greater emphasis on quality and service than they do in the U.S. She adds that some technological advances trail those in the U.S. because the Japanese still import basic operating systems from American companies.

The climate was right for the new FASB. In the late 1960s some CPAs failed to correct such abuses as clients picking permissive rules that hyped earnings and stock prices. And in November 1970 Congress had passed a special act to overrule one board rule. Also, James Needham, an SEC commissioner, in April 1972 had warned that the industry might face a “federal agency writing accounting rules” if they rejected the FASB idea. Keepers of the books, dubbed “figure filberts,” loathed the threat.

CIA chief William Webster, hardly a Washington malcontent, got the debate started last week by noting that the executive order banning assassinations had contributed to U.S. paralysis during the coup. The CIA's Deputy Director of Operations, Richard Stoltz, tried to smooth things over a few days later, but instead simply underlined Mr. Webster's point. “The interpretation” of the executive order, Mr. Stoltz said, “and the way in which the various committees have over time interpreted it, has led in my view to a proper caution on the part of operators, including me.” In other words, Congress won't let the CIA do much of anything anymore, and that's fine with the CIA. The pay's the same, and the duty's lighter.

West Germany's Green Party joined its ideological soulmates Jeremy Rifkin and the Christic Institute in the legal battle to ground the Atlantis shuttle and its plutonium-powered Galileo probe to Jupiter. The anti-defense Greens wanted a Washington federal appeals court to block today's scheduled liftoff long enough for them to ask the World Court to “order” a permanent cancellation of the $1.5 billion flight. A three-judge appeals panel yesterday refused to comply, though liberal Judge Pat Wald went out of her way to deny that this was a “frivolous” case. Of course it was.

Ethiopian politics are the most sophisticated, secretive and Byzantine in all of black Africa. Remember that it took Mr. Mengistu many months, in what became known as the “creeping coup,” to topple Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974 and 1975. There is simply no way to engineer a succession covertly, as is sometimes possible elsewhere on the continent. But the U.S. has one great advantage: The Soviets are universally loathed throughout Ethiopia for what they did to the country this past decade - famine and all.

People tend to be most loyal to brands that have distinctive flavors, such as cigarettes and ketchup. Kathie Huff, a respondent in the Journal survey from Spokane, Wash., says her husband is adamant about eating only Hunt's ketchup. He simply can't stomach the taste of Heinz, she says. The 31-year-old homemaker adds, “The only other thing I'm really loyal to is my Virginia Slims cigarettes. Coke and Pepsi are all the same to me, and I usually buy whichever brand of coffee happens to be on sale.”

First, generalize. Shorn of all their riders, special provisions, and other bells and whistles, insurance policies can still be grouped under two broad categories: so-called pure insurance, which amasses no cash value in the policy and pays off only upon death, and permanent insurance, which provides not only a death benefit but also a cash value in the policy that can be used in various ways while the insured is still alive.

Still, Britain's current slump is a cause for concern here as the nation joins in the European Community's plan to create a unified market by 1992. Compared with the major economies on the Continent, the U.K. faces both higher inflation and lower growth in the next several months. As a result, Mr. Owen warned, investment will be more likely to flow toward the other European economies and “the U.K. will be less prepared for the single market.”

In “Chicken Soup,” Mr. Mason plays Jackie, a Jewish bachelor courting Maddie (Lynn Redgrave), an Irish widow and mother of three, against the wishes of his mother (Rita Karin) and her brother Michael (Brandon Maggart). It's worth noting that both disapproving relatives are immigrants. At least, they both speak with strong accents, as do Jackie and Maddie. It couldn't be more obvious that “Chicken Soup” is being made from an old recipe. And a safe one - imagine if the romance in question were between an Orthodox Jew and a member of the Nation of Islam.

In the end, after meeting with the former housekeeper, Stevens sits by the seashore at dusk, thinking of her and of his employer, and declares “I trusted. I trusted in his lordship's wisdom ....

While Friday's debacle involved mainly professional traders rather than investors, it left the market vulnerable to continued selling this morning, traders said. Stock-index futures contracts settled at much lower prices than indexes of the stock market itself. At those levels, stocks are set up to be hammered by index arbitragers, who lock in profits by buying futures when futures prices fall, and simultaneously sell off stocks. But nobody knows at what level the futures and stocks will open today.

New Environmentalism probably started in 1962 with the publication of Rachel Carson's book “Silent Spring.” Shortly thereafter, hysterical articles began to appear predicting that advanced industrial societies would produce a blackened, uninhabitable planet possibly by the turn of the century. These apocalyptic predictions were advanced by such stalwarts as Paul Ehrlich, Barry Commoner, Rene Dubois and George Wald. Writing in the 1960s Ms. Carson suggested that the human race could be eliminated in 20 years, and Mr. Wald suggested that life on earth might end by 1985. Mr. Ehrlich predicted unprecedented famine by 1980. There were many more. Thousands of chemical products were categorized as carcinogenic, with recommendations that they be banned from industrial use because they produced malignant tumors in overdosed rats. Unknown before 1960 were the inconclusive effects of acid rain, greenhouse warming and ozone depletion, all of which required burgeoning political power and gargantuan expense.

Yet these figures show only the most visible part of the problem. Recent data from New York City provide more of the picture. While by no means the highest crime community in the country, New York is a prime example of a city where crime strangles small-business development. A survey of small businesses there was conducted this spring by Interface, a policy research organization. It gave 1,124 businesses a questionnaire and analyzed 353 responses. The survey found that over a three-year period 22% of the firms said employees or owners had been robbed on their way to or from work or while on the job. Seventeen percent reported their customers being robbed. Crime was the reason that 26% reported difficulty recruiting personnel and that 19% said they were considering moving.

On Seventh Avenue, designers have been advancing the monochrome look with clothing collections done entirely in black and white.

For eight hours a day for the past two weeks, in aggregates of as much as 27,000 pounds (equaling $20,000 in pennies), Coin Wrap has been pouring money into a cement-mixing truck. A giant heater, working like a blowtorch, causes the mud to crust and burns off any wrappers. After clanging around for an hour or so, the shiny, hot money pours out of the cement chute, where a giant vacuum sucks away the dried mud and burnt wrappers. After cooling, the coins are then rewrapped.

At Shearson Lehman, executives created potential new commercials Friday night and throughout the weekend, then had to regroup yesterday afternoon.

With some new rules, state officials say they made it easier - and faster - to sell new franchises whose terms stray from those in state-registered contracts. Previously, regulators insisted that franchisers pre-register such changes with the state - a costly process taking at least six weeks. Now some negotiated sales that meet a series of tests don't have to be pre-registered. For instance, franchisers no longer must pre-register sales to aspiring franchisees who qualify as “sophisticated purchasers.” Such buyers must have a minimum net worth of $1 million, $200,000 annual income, or recent experience in the business area of the franchise being sold.

GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Prices closed mostly higher in relatively light trading as farmers continued to withhold their crops from the marketplace in the hope of higher prices to come. Trading was muted in part because of the observance of All Saints' Day across much of Europe. Continued export demand also supported prices. As an indicator of the tight grain supply situation in the U.S., market analysts said that late Tuesday the Chinese government, which often buys U.S. grains in quantity, turned instead to Britain to buy 500,000 metric tons of wheat. Traders said prices also were supported by widespread rumors that the Soviet Union is on the verge of receiving most favored nation status from the U.S. That designation would, among other things, provide more generous credit terms under which the Soviets could purchase grain. The Soviets are widely believed to need additional supplies, despite running up record one-month purchases of 310 million bushels of corn in October.

To many Japanese, pachinko is benign or enticingly unsavory. Garish neon pachinko marquees blaze from the main streets and narrow alleys of cities and towns across the country. Devotees pass hours, watching the lights blink and listening to the metal balls ping, as much to gamble as to get a little time to be anonymous, alone with their thoughts. At 500 yen ($3.60) for a handful of balls, pachinko is a common pastime, and has been since it took root as cheap entertainment in the years after World War II.

- PROPERTY. Rigid ideological restrictions on property ownership should be abandoned. The document proposes breaking up the monolithic system of state-owned enterprises and farms and allowing a big private sector to flourish, helped by tough anti-monopoly legislation. The economy would be thrown open to numerous types of ownership between now and 1992, including factories leased by workers or owned by shareholders, cooperatives and joint ventures. Some forms of private property would be sanctioned. Such moves would greatly reduce the power of government ministries, who now jealously guard their turf and are seen as one of the major obstacles blocking economic reform.

The measure provides no money for the promised payments until then, but beginning in fiscal 1991, the government would be committed to meeting annual payments of as much as $500 million until the total liability of approximately $1.25 billion is paid.

When two parties engage in an interest-rate swap, they are betting against each other on future rates. Thus, an institution obligated to make fixed-rate interest payments on debt swaps the payments with another making floating-rate payments. In most of the British transactions, the municipalities agreed to make floating-rate payments to banks, which would make fixed-rate payments.

Six months ago, as some personnel specialists saw it, a perception that President Bush really cared about fair employment - after what they said was eight years of Reagan-era neglect - was prodding top management to raise hiring goals for females, blacks and other minorities. The perception lingers, says an official at a major industrial company. But so far, he declares, there's little evidence the “new urgency” is trickling down to the managers who actually do hiring. “Is there really a commitment or an illusion of activity?” he asks.

In “Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History” (Norton, 326 pages, $19.95), Mr. Gould makes his case for “the awesome improbability of human evolution.” The argument turns on the discovery in 1909 of an amazing fossil quarry high in the Canadian Rockies called the Burgess Shale. Here, in an area smaller than a city block, lay buried traces of countless weird creatures that had frolicked more than 500 million years ago - creatures whose anatomical variety far exceeded what can be found in all the world's oceans today.

Raising stock-index futures margins sharply could curtail the volume of index arbitrage trading by the handful of Wall Street securities firms that dominate the business. But these firms, many of whom say they have already quit doing index arbitrage trades for their own accounts, are especially resourceful when it comes to taking advantage of profitable opportunities. A few firms, while claiming not to trade for their own accounts, are effectively doing just that in the guise of executing customer orders, then quietly splitting the profits with their customers, futures traders say.

Obviously, it's harder to establish a sense of place in a one-shot TV movie. But tonight's offering, “Settle the Score” (9-11 p.m. EST, on NBC), doesn't even try. This tale of a Chicago policewoman returning home to find the man who raped her 20 years earlier is supposed to be set in the Ozarks. But it's more like an illustration of what Ben Stein describes in his study of social attitudes in the TV industry: “Fear of violence and animosity ... because of race or religion, fear and lack of comprehension about the politics of small-town people ... produce a powerful wave of dislike of small towns in the minds of TV writers and producers.”

PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices jumped to life, bestirred by a highly volatile stock market and the resignation of a key figure in the Conservative government of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. December gold climbed above the critical $375-an-ounce level to settle at $375.40, up $3.10. December silver added 7.7 cents to close at $5.237 an ounce. January platinum tacked on $3.60 an ounce to settle at $490. Market analysts said that continued declines and volatility in the stock market contributed generally to enhanced investor interest in precious metals, but that the British political news was the main factor boosting prices: Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson resigned. Sir Alan Walters, Mrs. Thatcher's economic adviser, also announced that he will resign. With the metals markets closed in London when the news was announced, a lot of U.K. buying came to the U.S., said Peter Cardillo, commodities trading adviser for Josephthal & Co. in New York. Mr. Cardillo noted that the drop in the British pound following Mr. Lawson's resignation fueled the metals' rally as investors sought a safe haven. He said he believes the rally in the metals is going to be very short-lived. WilliamO'Neill, research director of Elders Futures Inc., said that if December gold can close above $375 for two consecutive days, he would regard that as a bullish sign. However, he expected any strong rallies to be met by producer selling. “Both the Soviet Union and South Africa must sell these rallies,” he said. The two countries are major producers of precious metals. But he also noted that if uncertainty continues in the stock market, that might create some investor interest in precious metals. That interest has been lacking for a long time, he said.

As a result, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government isn't currently expected to ease interest rates before next spring, if then.

Though no formal trade barriers exist, the Japanese computer industry is difficult for outsiders to enter. “If it were an open market, we would have been in in 1983 or 1984,” says Eckhard Pfeiffer, who heads Compaq Computer Corp.'s European and international operations. His company, without any major effort, sells more machines in China than in Japan. Although it has opened a New Zealand subsidiary, it is still only “studying” Japan, the only nation that hasn't adopted IBM-oriented specifications. And because general retail centers such as ComputerLand have little presence in Japan, sales remain in the iron grip of established computer makers.

As more managers pursue the index-arbitrage strategy, these small opportunities between markets will be reduced and, eventually, eliminated. The current opportunities arise because the process for executing a buy or sell order in the actual stocks that make up the S&P 500 is more cumbersome than transacting in the futures market. The New York Stock Exchange's attempt to introduce a new portfolio basket is evidence of investors' desires to make fast and easy transactions of large numbers of shares.

Chairman Krebs says the California pension fund is getting a bargain price that wouldn't have been offered to others. In other words: The real estate has a higher value than the pending deal suggests.

And, as Mr. Zell says, with Itel and O&Y on the unit's board, the real estate will be run by “a very unusual group” to say the least.

Employee-benefit specialists drew a collective sigh of relief in early October when the Labor Department backed away from a proposal that companies let former employees and beneficiaries - along with active workers - borrow against balances in 401 (k) and similar savings plans. In an advisory letter, the department said that, starting Oct. 18, loans could be limited to “parties in interest,” which generally means active workers but also includes retirees who continue as directors and 10% shareholders.

Perhaps because they won, Mr. Bork's attackers come through more vividly than his defenders.

But it was Ted Kennedy who scored most effectively with his searing portrayal of “Robert Bork's America” - the parade of imaginary horribles that would follow logically, he claimed, from the positions Mr. Bork had taken over the space of two decades.

The catalyst for all this has been OPEC.

Saudi Arabia, OPEC's kingpin, abandoned a policy of flooding the market to punish quota-cheaters. About the same time, the Iran-Iraq war, which was roiling oil markets, ended.

Mr. Mason says he's convinced the public still wants to invest in common stocks, even though they believe the deck is stacked against them. But “these wide swings scare them to death.” All of this is bad news for the big brokerage firms such as Shearson and Merrill Lynch & Co. that have big “retail,” or individual-investor, businesses. After expanding rapidly during the bull-market years up to the 1987 crash, retail brokerage operations these days are getting barely enough business to pay the overhead.

By contrast, rentals in the best retail locations in Boston, San Francisco and Chicago rarely top $100 a square foot.

Only at the moment of maximum roll did I grasp what was going on. Then I remembered the quake of '71, which I experienced in Santa Barbara in a second-story motel room. When the swaying of the building woke me up, I reasoned that a) I was in Southern California; b) the bed was moving; c) it must be a Magic Fingers bed that had short-circuited. Then I noticed the overhead light was swaying on its cord and realized what had happened. What should I do? Get out of the possibly collapsing building to the parking lot. But the lot might split into crevasses, so I had better stand on my car, which probably was wider than the average crevasse. Fortunately, the quake was over before I managed to run out and stand naked on the hood.

This has some logic. Drug makers shouldn't be able to duck liability because people couldn't identify precisely which identical drug was used. But courts quickly tumbled down a slippery slope. Just as all plaintiffs are not alike, it turns out that DES defendants marketed the drugs differently and may have offered different warranties. The ultimate result came in Hymowitz v.

Mr. Sonnett said that clients who pay cash may include alleged drug dealers who don't have domestic bank accounts. These individuals may not necessarily be under investigation when they hire lawyers.

Filling out detailed forms about these individuals would tip the IRS off and spark action against the clients, he said.

Dr. Vogelstein next turned his attention to colon cancer, the second biggest cancer killer in the U.S. after lung cancer. He believed colon cancer might also arise from multiple “hits” on cancer suppressor genes, because it often seems to develop in stages. It often is preceded by the development of polyps in the bowel, which in some cases become increasingly malignant in identifiable stages - progressing from less severe to deadly - as though a cascade of genetic damage might be occurring.

But Dr. Vogelstein had yet to nail the identity of the gene that, if damaged, flipped a colon cell into full-blown malignancy. They focused on chromosome 17. For months the Johns Hopkins researchers, using gene probes, experimentally crawled down the length of chromosome 17, looking for the smallest common bit of genetic material lost in all tumor cells. Such a piece of DNA would probably constitute a gene.

Plump Beau, looking eager to please with his arched eyebrows and round face, plays the older brother, Frank. Frank plans the program, takes care of business, and approaches the work like any other job. He's even able to think of a job that takes him out of the house 300 nights a week as an ordinary job. He's got a wife and two kids and a house in the suburbs; the audience sees only the house, and only near the end of the movie. Frank grovels a little for the bookers, probably no more or less than he would have to if he worked for a big corporation. On his off-hours he wears cardigan sweaters.

The problems were uncovered during a series of internal investigations of the company's Space Systems division, which has been the focus of two separate overcharge prosecutions by the government since 1985.

Last November, a federal grand jury indicted GE on charges of fraud and false claims in connection with an alleged scheme to defraud the Army of $21 million on a logistics computer contract.

What has changed is that more of the young elderly are living with spouses rather than with other relatives, such as children.

The process typically begins when an institution, such as Citibank or Sears, Roebuck & Co., takes a pool of credit-card or other receivables and sells them to a specially created trust. The trust then issues securities - generally due in five years or less - that are underwritten by Wall Street brokerage firms and offered to investors. Issues typically come with “credit enhancements,” such as a bank letter of credit, and thus have received high credit ratings.

Democracy is forcing the abortion debate toward healthy compromise, toward the unpolarizing middle. Roe v. Wade pre-empted political debate, so the extremes blossomed. Now the ambivalent middle, a moral majority of sorts, is reasserting itself. Within a few years, the outcome in most states is likely to be that abortion will be more restricted, but not completely banned. This is where the voters are, which is where politicians usually end up.

Specialists were criticized for their inability to maintain orderly markets during the Friday plunge. But yesterday, even with halts in such major blue-chip stocks as Merck, “we expected (the halts) and it wasn't too bad,” said Donaldson's Mr. Eppel, who had been critical of the specialists' performance on Friday.

Surveys suggested that consumer confidence was high before Friday. A 190-point drop isn't likely to make much of a dent; multiply that a few times over, though, and it will.

And if foreign investors become a tad more cautious - well, the dollar's recent strength suggests that the U.S. can stand it.

The brief makes roughly the same argument the government made last week in a brief urging more leeway for states to restrict abortions. The brief filed yesterday says state regulations need only be “reasonable” to withstand federal court review, an easy standard for states to satisfy. Moreover, the brief is critical of arguments for a constitutional right to privacy, saying any right for competent individuals to refuse medical treatment should be rooted in tradition and based on the 14th Amendment “due process” protection of “liberty,” not on “abstract notions” of privacy, which the Constitution doesn't mention.

Mr. Sanford was told Mr. Noriega's friend, Mr. Wittgreen, would be handling the shah's security. It wouldn't be a good idea to indict him - much less Mr. Noriega, the prosecutor was told.

Ms. Dash is far from alone. Shopping has become such a chore that more people hate browsing in stores than hate doing household work, according to The Wall Street Journal's “American Way of Buying” survey.

Yankelovich, Clancy, Shulman, a market research firm in Westport, Conn., warns clients that Americans' love affair with shopping is on the rocks: More than half the women it has surveyed in recent years, and an even larger percentage of men, say shopping for clothes is a hassle.

How should a reasonable member of the Federal Reserve Board interpret a congressional decision to put the secretary on the board?

Another concern is liquidity, or how easily a security can be converted into cash. The secondary, or resale, market for asset-backed securities is relatively new and much less active than for Treasury issues. That could make it tricky for investors who need to sell their holdings quickly before the securities mature. That's particularly true, analysts say, for certain of the securities, such as those backed by time-share loans. “You could see massive gyrations here because it's such a thinly traded market,” says Jonathan S.

The slaughter in Colombia was very much on the minds of 450 editors and publishers from Latin America, the United States, the Caribbean and Canada attending the 45th general assembly of the Inter-American Press Association in Monterrey, Mexico, this week. On Tuesday the conference got word of another atrocity, the assassination in Medellin of two employees of El Espectador, Colombia's second-largest newspaper. The paper's local administrator, Maria Luz Lopez, was shot dead, and her mother wounded, while her car was stopped for a red light.

Most notably, several of the regulatory steps recommended by the Brady Task Force, which analyzed the 1987 crash, would be revived - especially because that group's chairman is now the Treasury secretary. The most controversial of the Brady recommendations involved establishing a single overarching regulator to handle crucial cross-market questions, such as setting consistent margin requirements for the stock and futures markets.

The problem here goes well beyond twisting legal doctrine. The California Supreme Court last year reversed direction to make it much harder to win DES cases because the justices saw how all the pharmaceutical litigation has chilled the introduction of new drugs. The court rejected strict liability for prescription drugs, citing the huge, hidden social costs. “Public policy favors the development and marketing of beneficial new drugs, even though some risks, perhaps serious ones, might accompany their introduction because drugs can save lives and reduce pain and suffering,” the unanimous court said. The California justices noted that the fear of litigation already forced the only remaining anti-morning-sickness drug, Bendectin, off the U.S. market.

The Bush administration has sent conflicting signals about its export-control policies, reflecting unhealed divisions among several competing agencies. Last summer, Mr. Bush moved the administration in the direction of gradual liberalization when he told a North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting that he would allow some exceptions to the Cocom embargo of strategic goods. But more recently, the Pentagon and the Commerce Department openly feuded over the extent to which Cocom should liberalize exports of personal computers to the bloc.

In the two weeks since the rebellion, which the U.S. hesitantly backed, Mr. Noriega has been at his most brutal - and efficient - in maintaining power. Yet, while the failed coup is a major U.S. foreign policy embarrassment, it is merely the latest chapter in a byzantine relationship between Mr. Noriega and Washington that stretches back three decades. America's war on the dictator over the past two years, following his indictment on drug charges in February 1988, is the legacy of that relationship. Before American foreign policy set out to destroy Noriega, it helped create him out of the crucible of Panama's long history of conspirators and pirates.

Finally, I think it important to point out the extraordinarily high visibility of non-violent civil disobedience in these days of intensive media coverage. Give television a chance to cover live any breaking of the law, and no second invitation will be required. This brings into question the motives of those who lead civil disobedience demonstrations. Do they want the spotlight for themselves or for their cause? Here is a good rule of thumb: If the movement produced the leader, the chance that he is sincere is much greater than if the leader produced the movement. In either case, ask yourself whether you have become better informed on the issues under protest by watching the act of civil disobedience. If you have not, it is probable that a thorough airing of the dispute by calm and rational debate would have been the better course.

Congress, with a measure of White House complicity, has been manipulating the spending accounts for years under the cover of omnibus appropriations bills.

Digital is promising a new approach. Robert M.

Sony and the Guber Peters executives say in their countersuit, however, that the new contract eliminated language barring the two from serving “in any other capacity” in the motion picture business. And they appear to be relying heavily on an alleged “oral agreement” the two producers claim to have with Warner that would let them out of their written contract in the event that an actual executive post at another company became available. In their countersuit, they say that on two previous occasions - once in 1987 when they considered a post at Columbia, and once when Messrs. Guber and Peters tried to buy a stake in MGM\/UA in 1988 - Warner was prepared to release them from their contract. The countersuit also charges Warner with making the oral agreement to “falsely induce” them into a new written contract in 1989. Moreover, they say, Warner is trying to cheat them out of “a unique business opportunity” and the fulfilment of their “long-term dream” to run their own studio.

Third, the theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking have lower security in office. For example, first-term members of the House, once the most vulnerable of incumbents, have become virtually immune to defeat. The one exception to this recent trend was the defeat of 13 of the 52 freshman Republicans brought into office in 1980 by the Reagan revolution and running for re-election in 1982. Because these freshmen placed far more emphasis on their partisan role - spreading the Reagan revolution - in national policy making, they were more vulnerable to defeat.

I compared one universal policy for $130,000 face amount from such an insurer, American Life Insurance Corp. of Lincoln, Neb., with a similar offering from Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S., which operates through 11,000 commissioned salesmen.

At age 65, when I'd stop paying premiums, the Ameritas offering would have a projected cash value $14,000 higher than the other, even though the Equitable's policy illustration assumed a fractionally higher interest rate.

The network must refund money to the advertisers and loses considerable revenue and prestige. The demonstrators have been non-violent, but the result of their trespasses has been to seriously impair the rights of others unconnected with their dispute.

House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten (D., Miss.) helped secure $49.7 million for his state, or more than double the Pentagon's budget. West Virginia, home of Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd, would receive $21.5 million - four times the military's request. Tennessee and North Carolina, home states of the two Democratic chairmen of the House and Senate military construction subcommittees, receive $243.2 million, or 25% above the Pentagon's request. Though spending for Iowa and Oregon was far less, their increases above Pentagon requests - 640% and 430%, respectively - were much greater because of the influence of Republicans at critical junctures.

President Bush badly wants a line-item veto and has long called for a law giving it to the president. Now the White House is declaring that he might not rely on Congress - which hasn't shown any willingness to surrender such authority - to pass the line-item veto law he seeks.

The problem is that on the vital issue of monetary policy and exchange rates, conservative, free-market economists divide into at least three incompatible camps. There are the strict monetarists, who believe that floating exchange rates free an economy to stabilize its price level by stabilizing the monetary aggregates. There are the supply-side globalists, who seek to spread the advantages of a common currency through fixed exchange rates. And there are the twin-deficit Keynesians, who predict\/advocate devaluations to balance trade flows. This is a problem not only for Prime Minister Thatcher but for President Bush, as shown in the ongoing bickering over the dollar between the Federal Reserve and the Mulford Treasury.

Mr. Kloves has put together some priceless moments. These include Jennifer Tilly's audition to be the Baker Boys' girl singer. Ms. Tilly of the tweety-bird voice showed great comic promise during her stint as the mobster's girlfriend on the television show, “Hill Street Blues.” Here she delivers, especially during her enthusiastically awful rendition of the “Candy Man,” which she sings while prancing around in a little cotton candy pink angora sweater that couldn't be more perfect. (It matches her voice.) And Ms. Pfeiffer's particular version of “Making Whoopee” - and the way Mr. Ballhaus photographs her, from the tips of her red high heels right up her clingy red velvet dress - might make you think of Marilyn Monroe if Ms. Pfeiffer hadn't gone and become a star in her own right.

This recommendation might have encouraged a turf-hungry bureaucrat to try to expand his power, but so far Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan hasn't made a pitch for the job. The Fed has plenty of responsibilities in times of market turmoil and in 1987 and again in 1989 it appears to have handled them well. Mr. Brady has said he thought government agencies in the latest market drop were better prepared to coordinate their actions, but he has left no doubt that he still likes the ideas the commission advanced nearly two years ago.

COCOA: The modest sell-off, which started on Tuesday, continued. The December contract ended at $999 a metric ton, down $15. The market is drifting, at least partly, because of a lack of crop information out of Ghana and the Ivory Coast, the two largest African producers. Harry Schwartz, a soft commodity specialist for Cargill Investors Services in New York, said the only report Ghana has issued about the arrival of cocoa from the interior was for 7,839 metric tons as of Oct. 12. By this time last year, he noted, arrivals totaling 33,270 tons had been announced. A similar situation apparently exists in the Ivory Coast with no figures released yet this year, compared with 55,000 tons as of this time a year ago. He said that if little cocoa actually has arrived at the ports, shipping delays could result. This is the worry that probably brought steadiness to the market earlier in the week, he said. There was also some fear that without Ivory Coast cocoa a large French cocoa merchant, Cie. Financiere Sucre et Denrees, might not be able to deliver cocoa against the contracts it had sold earlier for December delivery in London. However, the French merchant has about 200,000 tons of old crop Ivory Coast cocoa stored in the Netherlands from an agreement it had negotiated with the Ivory Coast last spring. Cargill thinks that even though the merchant has a contract stating that it won't bring this cocoa to market until after March 1991, there is some evidence the contract has been modified. This modification, apparently, would permit the French merchant to deliver this cocoa, if necessary, against existing short positions.

Though smaller in total dollars, the conference agreed to preserve an estimated $30.6 million in controversial subsidies to carriers serving rural or isolated airports. The sum is more than double what the House had approved for the program, but the list of qualified airports would be cut by 22 under new distance requirements and limits on the level of subsidy. Congress previously cut six airports this year. The impact of the changes is to eliminate many of the most excessive cases where the government has been paying more than $200 for each passenger in subsidies.

One reason futures are said to add volatility is that - unlike in stocks - people can speculate in futures with little money down.

But most companies are too afraid to take that chance. And perhaps with good reason. Says Clayt Wilhite, president of theD'Arcy Masius ad agency's U.S. division, “Every time 24 hours pass without any advertising reinforcement, brand loyalty will diminish ever so slightly - even for a powerful brand like Budweiser.”

Lisa Zeidner's third novel, “Limited Partnerships” (North Point Press, 256 pages, $18.95) is a stylish, funny and thoughtful look at the way love relationships are affected by the pressures of money, or, more specifically, the lack of it. Nora Worth and Malcolm DeWitt, 33 and 39 respectively, live together in a townhouse in a transitional Philadelphia neighborhood. Malcolm, a former film-maker turned architect, has just seen his first big chance at a lucrative commission turn to dust with the arrest of his shady, obnoxious client, a fly-by-night real estate developer. Nora, who still has artistic aspirations, knows she is lucky to be working as a food stylist, prepping pies, burgers, frosty cold drinks and other comestibles to look as appetizing as possible in front of the camera. After all, she reasons, “there were housewives with Nikons and degrees from cooking schools in France who would kill for her job.” But Nora and Malcolm feel trapped. They seem to be having the “worst of both worlds: artistic work with none of art's integrity and no control over the finished product; self-employment without fun or profit.”

When Scoring High first came out in 1979, it was a publication of Random House. McGraw-Hill was outraged.

Francis Palamara, a New Yorker who runs the 15-trader office. London's blue-chip stock index turned up just before 8 a.m. New York time, sending an encouraging message to Wall Street.

And South Carolina says it is getting results. Since the reforms went in place, for example, no state has posted a higher rate of improvement on the Scholastic Aptitude Test than South Carolina, although the state still posts the lowest average score of the about 21 states who use the SAT as the primary college entrance examination. Critics say South Carolina is paying a price by stressing improved test scores so much. Friends of Education rates South Carolina one of the worst seven states in its study on academic cheating. Says the organization's founder, John Cannell, prosecuting Mrs. Yeargin is “a way for administrators to protect themselves and look like they take cheating seriously, when in fact they don't take it seriously at all.”
