Why does this large hypothetical seller trade in Chicago instead of New York? Perhaps he is willing to sacrifice to the arbitrage trader some small profit in order to get quick and certain execution of his large trade. In a competitive market, this investor has many ways to execute his transactions, and he will have more alternatives (both foreign and domestic) if his volume is profitable for an exchange to handle. If not Chicago, then in New York; if not the U.S., then overseas.

Then, in May 1988, Mr. Tisch urgently needed to make a bold statement to quell rumors that he might sell the network. Mr. Pilson gave him one: He bid $243 million for rights to the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville, France; ABC and NBC wouldn't bid even $200 million. That started the still-raging bidding wars.

COPPER: Futures prices fell. The December contract dropped 1.35 cents to settle at $1.142 a pound. Mr.O'Neill said copper's price action this week indicates general weakness. “It easily violated major support at $1.19 and then {yesterday} closed under secondary support at $1.15,” he said. He believes the next area of technical support is at the $1.10 level. Mr.O'Neill said the market was hit on Wednesday with the news that the atmosphere surrounding the negotiations on the strike at Bougainville, Papua New Guinea, may have improved. But he said he doubts that a settlement is anywhere in sight. He also believes that the market may have already discounted any good news that might be associated with this strike. Mr. Cardillo said that copper is reflecting a weakening U.S. economy and that he would be neither a buyer nor a seller at these levels.

In reference to your Sept. 11 article “ROTC Regains Respect on Campuses as Graduates Fare Well in Workplace,” we want to clarify an erroneous impression regarding the Villanova Naval ROTC Program for 1971-1974. Joseph Hebert III was incorrectly identified. He was not an instructor at Villanova but was a recruiter who traveled to many universities. The Naval ROTC program at Villanova never held meetings at fraternity houses as we have no fraternity houses. Villanova University and the surrounding community have supported the Navy 100% every year since World War II and the university is recognized as unequaled in providing the best of support to the Navy. All that occurred during the Vietnam era was an occasional sign-carrying student near the parade ground in peaceful protest, but no effort was made to disrupt the Naval ROTC activities.

Experts say such long hours for attendants pose a safety risk. For instance, tired flight attendants might not react quickly enough during an emergency evacuation. “At the end of their day, they are zombies,” says John Galipault, president of the Aviation Safety Institute, a public-interest group in Worthington, Ohio. “They have to work such long hours and then we expect them to be heroes if there's an evacuation.” In response to the study, the FAA says it is considering changing its policy - or lack of it - on flight attendants. The agency may not have much choice: A congressional bill has been introduced that would force the agency to limit flight attendant duty time to 14 hours on U.S. flights and 16 hours on international trips.

As the days go by, the South African government will be ever more hard pressed to justify the continued imprisonment of Mr. Mandela as well as the continued banning of the ANC and enforcement of the state of emergency.

The two-story roadway, designed in the mid-1940s and completed in 1957, was supported by columns that apparently lacked the kind of steel reinforcement used in highways today. While the pillars did have long metal bars running vertically through them for reinforcement, they apparently lacked an adequate number of metal “ties” that run horizontally through the column, said Leo Parker, a structural engineer in Los Angeles. Caltrans today uses a variation of the design Mr. Parker describes, with spiraling steel rods inside.

The spokesman said sales of reinforced-fiberglass material to the boat-building industry also were weak, largely because of softening in the marine market. Weakness in the auto industry also is expected to continue through the rest of the year.

However, Owens-Corning was able to offset that decline somewhat with new business at General Motors Corp., which recently introduced a new, plastic-body van.

New Jersey is a proving ground for this aggressive women's-rights movement this year. The infusion of activists can bring a clash of cultures. In Cherry Hill, the National Abortion Rights Action League, whose goal is to sign up 50,000 pro-choice voters, targets a union breakfast to build labor support for its cause. The league organizers seem more a fit with a convention next door of young aerobics instructors in leotards than the beefy union leaders; “I wish I could go work out,” says a slim activist. A labor chief speaks sardonically of having to “man and woman” Election Day phones.

Dr. Vogelstein and a doctoral student, Eric Fearon, began months of tedious and often frustrating probing of the chromosomes searching for signs of genetic damage. They began uncovering a confusing variety of genetic deletions, some existing only in benign polyps, others in malignant cells and many in both polyps and malignant cells. Gradually, a coherent picture of cancer development emerged. If both copies of a certain gene were knocked out, benign polyps would develop. If both copies of a second gene were then deleted, the polyps would progress to malignancy. It was clear that more than one gene had to be damaged for colon cancer to develop.

The term “margin” has slightly different meanings in the stock and futures markets, but they both describe the amount of cash investors must put up to get into the game. Stock margins are literally down payments made toward the purchase of a stock, and the level is set by the Federal Reserve Board.

COCOA: Futures at first continued the rally begun on Monday, but then faltered and closed lower. The December contract opened just under Monday's close, triggered some previously placed buy orders just above $1,030 a metric ton, pushing the price to $1,040, and then encountered heavy selling by traders who buy and sell for their own accounts and by commercial interests. The contract settled at $1,014 a ton, off $13. Robert Hafer, senior commodities analyst at Kaiser Financial Group, said Monday's rally continued yesterday for only about 20 minutes after the opening. He said even though there was arbitrage buying in New York because of the weak dollar, cocoa fell to relentless pressure from bearish traders. But he noted that speculators apparently don't believe there is much more of a decline in store for cocoa. The December contract reached its life-of-contract low of $975 a ton on Oct. 11; its lifetime high was $1,735, set in 1988, and its recent high was $1,368, set in early August. The last time cocoa traded at prices as low as currently was in 1974. But while further modest declines might be ahead, Mr. Hafer said it would be difficult to get through resistance levels just above yesterday's high.

- For the last two weeks, the Bush administration and the Federal Reserve have been engaged in a semi-public battle over international economic policy.

Cast as Violetta Valery in a new production of Verdi's “La Traviata,” Ms. Gruberova last week did many things nicely and others not so well. It isn't every day that we hear a Violetta who can sing the first act's high-flying music with all the little notes perfectly pitched and neatly stitched together. Never once did she gasp for air or mop her brow. She was as cool as a cucumber. But as you may know, things are not going well for Violetta. There are times when she must show a little emotion. She has TB, after all, and a weak-kneed lover; and though a successful courtesan, she is just about overdrawn at the bank.

NCNB, based in Charlotte, N.C., bought the banking assets of failed First Republic Bank Corp. of Dallas last year in a transaction expected to cost the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. about $3 billion. (First Republic isn't related to First Republic Bancorp of San Francisco.) Robert Rieke, an analyst with Raucher Pierce Refsnes Inc., Dallas, estimates Houston-based First City's third-quarter net was higher than second quarter earnings of $28.1 million. However, he estimated that per-share earnings stayed “relatively flat” at about the second quarter's $1.19 a share because the total number of shares outstanding increased.

This narrator is a foil for Mr. Vargas Llosa, a cosmopolitan writer with one well-tailored leg in journalism. He is in Florence to shake himself free of Peru and get some writing done, just as Mr. Vargas Llosa has gone to Paris and now goes frequently to London for the same purpose. But this narrator happens upon some photographs in a gallery, pictures taken in Peruvian Amazonia of the untamed and nomadic Machiguenga tribe. And they remind him of his own experiences with that unhappy scattered culture and of his friend at Lima's University of San Marcos, Saul Zuratas. Saul was a high-strung student of ethnography, a Jew marked doubly as an outsider because of a huge wine-dark birthmark on his face, for which people called him Mascarita, Mask Face. Saul knew about the Machiguengas from his studies, and through him the narrator became interested in this most recalcitrant and un-Westernizable of all the indigenous peoples who had come under the Spanish yoke. Saul, meanwhile, came to believe that anthropology, even at its most benign, was as insidious a form of cultural imperialism as the superficially more blatant activities of Christian missionaries. Saul mysteriously disappears.

The once-staid steel industry is about to be turned topsy-turvy by a 1990s technology revolution. New, efficient and sophisticated processes make it easier for smaller, less cash-rich companies to make steel at a fraction of what Big Steel paid decades ago. It also enables minimills finally to get a toehold in the flat-rolled steel market - the major steelmakers' largest, most prized, and until now, untouchable, market.

Mr. Paul boasts that he spotted bargains in old masters just before they took an upward turn. “They went up 51% last year, and they'll do it again this year,” he declares. “They were a sleeper.

The state bar association's policy making body, the House of Delegate, voted Saturday to ask Chief Judge Sol Wachtler to give the bar's voluntary program three years to prove its effectiveness before considering mandatory pro bono. “We believe our suggested plan is more likely to improve the availability of quality legal service to the poor than is the proposed mandatory pro bono plan and will achieve that objective without the divisiveness, distraction, administrative burdens and possible failure that we fear would accompany an attempt to impose a mandatory plan,” said Justin L. Vigdor of Rochester, who headed the bar's pro bono study committee.

Consider, for instance, the very fat fowl known as federalized child care. The President came up with a good bill, but now may end up signing the awful bureaucratic creature hatched on Capitol Hill.

Conference participants saw these effects as flowing directly from (a) Marxist devaluation of environmental resources, which are not produced by labor; (b) planned economies' inability to control pollution where enterprises are state-owned and penalties are paid by the government; and (c) the continuing Stalinist emphasis on heavy industry for economic development, producing a far heavier and more wasteful use of energy and natural resources than in the West. They repeatedly noted that environmental progress could not be secured without true ownership, genuine competition based on market factors, and the risk of bankruptcy if a business makes the wrong decisions.

With the golden share as protection, Jaguar officials have rebuffed Ford's overtures, and moved instead to forge an alliance with GM. Jaguar officials have indicated they are close to wrapping up a friendly alliance with GM that would preserve Jaguar's independence, but no deal has been announced. Ford, on the other hand, has said it's willing to bid for all of Jaguar, despite the objections of Jaguar chairman Sir John Egan. Analysts continued to speculate late last week that Ford may try to force the issue by calling for a special shareholder's meeting and urging that the government and Jaguar holders remove the barriers to a full bidding contest before December 1990. But a Ford spokeswoman in Dearborn said Friday the company hasn't requested such a meeting yet.

The poll points up some inconsistencies between what people say and what they do. A surprising 78% of people said they exercise regularly, up from 73% in 1981. This conjures up images of a nation full of trim, muscular folks, and suggests couch potatoes are out of season. Of course, that isn't really the case. The discrepancy may be because asking people about their fitness regime is a bit like inquiring about their love life. They're bound to exaggerate.

The result is that instead of the Pentagon's proposed split of 60-40 between domestic and foreign bases, the reduced funding is distributed by a ratio of approximately 70-30.

Sun, Hewlett-Packard and others say Intel isn't wholly to blame for the snafu.

BLOCKBUSTER ENTERTAINMENT CORP. said it raised $92 million from an offering of liquid yield option notes. The gross proceeds from the sale of the notes, which will be due on Nov. 1, 2004, will be used to reduce existing debt and for general corporate purposes, the company said. The debt reduction is expected to save the Fort Lauderdale, Fla. home video concern about $2 million a year in interest expense. The zero-coupon subordinated notes have no periodic interest payments. Each note is being offered at $308.32 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, representing an 8% yield to maturity. In addition, each note can be converted into Blockbuster Entertainment common stock at a rate of 13.851 shares per note. Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. is the sole underwriter for the offering. The notes will have a principal amount of $300 million at maturity. Blockbuster shares closed yesterday at $18.75, down $1.125, in New York Stock Exchange trading.

Take Lake Vineyard Cabernet from Diamond Creek. It's made only in years when the grapes ripen perfectly (the last was 1979) and comes from a single acre of grapes that yielded a mere 75 cases in 1987. Owner Al Brownstein originally planned to sell it for $60 a bottle, but when a retailer in Southern California asked, “Is that wholesale or retail?” he re-thought the matter. Offering the wine at roughly $65 a bottle wholesale ($100 retail), he sent merchants around the country a form asking them to check one of three answers: 1) no, the wine is too high (2 responses); 2) yes, it's high but I'll take it (2 responses); 3) I'll take all I can get (58 responses). The wine was shipped in six-bottle cases instead of the usual 12, but even at that it was spread thin, going to 62 retailers in 28 states.

When the tremors struck, the region's largely unseen high-tech fabric held up surprisingly well despite the devastation visible from the air. Michael L. Bandler, vice president for network technology at Pacific Bell Telephone Co., says nearly all the network's computer switches, which move thousands of calls a minute from one location to another, changed to battery power when the city lost power. The battery packs have enough power for only three hours, but that gave emergency crews time to turn on an emergency system that runs primarily on diesel fuel. Of some 160 switches in Pacific Bell's network, only four went down. One of those was in Hollister, Calif., near the earthquake's epicenter.

NATIONWIDE HEALTH PROPERTIES, Pasadena, Calif., said it wouldn't pay its fourth-quarter dividend, despite a 44% increase in third-quarter earnings, to $3.5 million, or 42 cents a share. Net income included a gain of $708,000 on asset sales, the real estate investment trust said. A year earlier, Nationwide Health earned $2.4 million, or 29 cents a share. Revenue rose 3% to $9 million from $8.8 million. Nationwide Health said that although it has the cash to cover the 25-cent-a-share dividend, its banks have denied the company's request to pay it because the trust hasn't met certain terms. Nationwide Health said it has “numerous financing activities” under way to remedy the problem and will make up the dividend payment later if possible.

Industry executives and analysts are divided on whether Mr. Phillips is up to the task. He isn't as well-known to clients as is Mr. Roman.

Details and Camden are essential Florio. Elected to Congress as a “Watergate baby” in 1974, he ran for governor three years later. In the opinion of many, he hasn't stopped running since, even though he declined a rematch with Gov. Kean in 1985. His base in South Jersey and on the House Energy and Commerce Committee helped him sustain a network of political-action committees to preserve his edge. With limited budgets for television in a high-priced market, Mr. Florio's higher recognition than his rival is a major advantage.

At least three other factors have encouraged the IMF to insist on increased capital. First, it argues that its capital base must be increased in order to maintain its size relative to world financial markets, for which it feels some responsibility. Second, the World Bank's recent $75 billion capital increase - $14 billion from the U.S. - has left the IMF feeling less than first fiddle among international financial institutions. Third, the IMF would like to meet Japan's request for increased ownership (currently 4.5%). Japan has supported a larger role for the IMF in developing-country debt issues, and is an important financial resource for IMF-guided programs in developing countries.

Such efforts - unheard of only a few years ago - are the latest attempts to revive the sagging $1.76 billion U.S. ski industry. Since the start of the decade, lift-ticket sales have grown only 3% a year on average, compared with 16% annual growth rates in the '60s and '70s. Last season, lift-ticket sales fell for the first time in seven years. By some estimates, nearly a fourth of all U.S. ski areas have been forced to shut down since the early '80s.

The association, a majority of whose 156,000 members build fewer than 25 units a year, is like many other business lobbies. Explains Sheila MacDonald of the National Taxpayers Union: “It treads in two worlds. The builders like the subsidies, but at the same time they tend to be fiscal conservatives in terms of major issues, such as the balanced-budget amendment.” Unfortunately, the organization's desire for pork tends to override its commitment to overall fiscal responsibility. Two years ago when the NAHB lobbied for the $19 billion omnibus housing bill, the organization “basically dropped out of the taxpayers' coalition,” says Ms. MacDonald. As Mr. Colton of the NAHB acknowledges: “Government is not going to solve the problem .... The real key is to have the economy working and interest rates down.” More money for HUD will increase the deficit and destabilize the economy; more money to municipalities that are wrecking their local housing markets will further insulate them from the destructive effects of their policies. Is this what the home builders want?

Analysts are looking for Pepsi to earn as much as $1.04 a share, with most estimates settling around 99 cents, compared with 91 cents in the year-ago quarter. The latest quarter results, are expected to be a little soft compared with Pepsi's historical earnings growth rate, reflecting some dilution for snack-food and soft-drink bottling acquisitions. Stronger restaurant and snack-food sales helped boost Pepsi's profits, too, analysts said.

The Fed's move to ease credit wasn't an aggressive one, but it did signal a clear change of policy from before the stock market's swoon. Government officials say it's unclear, however, where the bellwether fed funds rate, which influences other interest rates, will come to rest.

Authorities at London's Heathrow Airport are investigating the disappearance of a Paul Gauguin watercolor, “Young Tahitian Woman in a Red Pareo,” that has two sketches on its verso (opposite) side. Valued at $1.3 million, it was part of a four-crate shipment. The air-waybill number was changed en route, and paper work showing that the crates had cleared customs was misplaced, so it was a week before three of the four crates could be located in a bonded warehouse and the Gauguin discovered missing. Although Heathrow authorities have been watching a group of allegedly crooked baggage handlers for some time, the Gauguin may be “lost.” Chief Inspector Peter Seacomb of the Criminal Investigation Department at the airport said, “It is not uncommon for property to be temporarily mislaid or misrouted.”

As the air clears from last week's storm of resignations and reshufflings, the government faces a daunting job of rebuilding confidence in its policies.

The two, Szeto Wah and Martin Lee, were deemed unfit because they had condemned China's crackdown on its pro-democracy movement. The committee is formulating Hong Kong's constitution for when it reverts to Chinese control in 1997, and Chinese lawmakers said the two can only return if they “abandon their antagonistic stand against the Chinese government and their attempt to nullify the Sino-British joint declaration on Hong Kong.”

Moreover, there are questions, particularly among atmospheric scientists who know this subject best, about the ability of anyone to know what in fact is happening to the ozone layer. It is generally agreed that when CFCs rise from earth to stratosphere, the chlorine in them is capable of interfering with the process through which ultraviolet rays split oxygen molecules and form ozone. But ozone creation is a very large-scale natural process and the importance of human-generated CFCs in reducing it is largely a matter of conjecture. The ozone layer is constantly in motion and thus very hard to measure. What scientists have known since the late 1970s is that there is a hole in the layer over Antarctica that expands or contracts from year to year. But it is at least worthy of some note that there are very few refrigerators in Antarctica. Moreover, surely someone has noticed that household refrigerators are closed systems, running for many years without either the CFC gas or the insulation ever escaping.

Onlookers say three persons died when one of the buildings exploded into a fireball shortly after the quake struck. Efforts to fight the blaze were hampered because water mains were severed as well. From the air, ribbons of yellow fire hose carry water from the bay to high-pressure nozzles trained on the site. As onlookers stand behind barricades, helmeted firemen and building inspectors survey rows of nearby buildings that were twisted from their foundations and seem on the verge of collapse.

Likewise, mutual funds remained relatively flat until I made what was, for me, a serious investment. By 1987, these properties were in a tailspin, causing my broker at Pru-Bache to remark that she'd “never seen anything like it.” Concerned for her state of mind, I dropped them - and the market instantly began its steady climb back to health. Perhaps most dramatic was the performance of the metropolitan New York real-estate market, which was booming until I entered it in late 1988, at which time it posted the first negative compound annual growth rate in years.

No doubt, Mr. Dinkins has been a calming influence. He is an avuncular figure who remembers the birthdays of colleagues' children, opens doors for women, and almost never has a bad word to say about anybody. More important, he emerged as a peacemaker last summer after the Central Park rape of a white jogger - in which a group of Harlem teens was charged - and the racial murder of a black teen-ager in the white Brooklyn neighborhood of Bensonhurst. Rather than scaring off white voters, as many predicted he would, Mr. Dinkins attracted many whites precisely because of his reputation for having a cool head. (Keeping cool is a Dinkins priority: On humid days this summer, he was known to change his double-breasted suits as many as four times a day.)

First Interstate stock closed at $57.625, down 25 cents, in composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.

Mr. Marrie said the problems in Arizona have only “increased our resolve to continue to make our restructuring even more effective.”

George Bush disclosed the policy last week by reading it to GOP senators, perhaps as a way of shifting blame for the Panama fiasco to Congress. But the broader truth is more complicated - and dismaying. The policy was contained in an exchange of letters last October between the Senate intelligence committee and the CIA and National Security Council. Staff lawyers for both sides were busy agreeing with one another about what the U.S. could not do to oust the Panamanian thug. They simply got carried away with interpreting what the executive order banning assassinations really meant. Mr. Boren himself didn't discover the warn-your-enemy nuance until Mr. Bush told him privately at the White House last week.

The researchers said they have isolated a plant gene that prevents the production of pollen. The gene thus can prevent a plant from fertilizing itself.

The framers hardly discussed the appropriations clause at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, according to Madison's notes. To the extent they did, their concern was to ensure fiscal accountability. Moreover, the framers believed that the nation needed a unitary executive with the independence and resources to perform the executive functions that the Confederation Congress had performed poorly under the Articles of Confederation. It would contradict that objective if the appropriations clause (technically a limitation on legislative power) could be read as placing the president on Congress's short leash, making the executive consist of the president and every member of Congress.

By and large, Mr. Dinkins has finessed the touchy question of whose ox he would gore. Instead of focusing on the financial future, Mr. Dinkins has sold himself as a unifier for a city recently touched by racial violence and as a soothing antidote to 12 years of commotion generated by Mayor Koch. “The thing about the Dinkins candidacy is that it offers hope to a broad range of people,” says Meyer Frucher, a real-estate executive and former aide to Gov. Mario Cuomo. “It is a feel-good candidacy.”

After the trading halt in the S&P 500 pit in Chicago, waves of selling continued to hit stocks themselves on the Big Board, and specialists continued to notch prices down.

Without the guidepost of stock-index futures - the barometer of where traders think the overall stock market is headed - many traders were afraid to trust stock prices quoted on the Big Board. The futures halt was even assailed by Big Board floor traders. “It screwed things up,” said one major specialist.

Now, with the opening of Maxim Gorky's bourgeois-bashing “Summerfolk,” Ms. Bogart has laid her cards on the table. Hers is a hand that will test the mettle of her audiences. For Ms. Bogart, who initially studied and directed in Germany (and cites such European directors as Peter Stein, Giorgio Strehler and Ariane Mnouchkine as influences) tends to stage her productions with a Brechtian rigor - whether the text demands it or not. And Gorky, considered the father of Soviet socialist realism, did not write plays that easily lend themselves to deliberately antirealistic distancing techniques.

Mr. Lorentz, an intense, cerebral product of France's elite “Ecole Nationald'Administration” likes to go rock climbing in his spare time, and used to practice the martial art of aikido. He will discuss frankly Bull's past problems; when asked if the company has suffered from an unfocussed image, he readily agrees. He allows that the products of all computer makers are getting more and more alike - “a certain banalization” he calls it - and that specialized service will make the difference in the future. “How we manage the problem of service will make all the difference between now and 1995,” he says. After having added Zenith PCs to the Bull stable, Mr. Lorentz says, the company will be better armed for battle especially in Europe. “Our biggest asset is that we are well implanted in Europe, and Europe will be the fastest growing market in the world over the next 10 years.” But the conquest of Europe will happen, in part, from the U.S.

Mr. Glass has inverted the famous modernist dictum “less is more.” His more is always less. Far from being minimalist, the music unabatingly torments us with apparent novelties not so cleverly disguised in the simplicities of 4\/4 time, octave intervals, and ragtime or gospel chord progressions. But the music has its charm, and Mr. Glass has constructed his solo program around a move from the simple to the relatively complex. “Opening” (1981), from Glassworks, introduces the audience to the Glass technique: Never straying too far from the piano's center, Mr. Glass works in the two octaves on either side of middle C, and his fingers seldom leave the keys. There is a recognizable musical style here, but not a particular performance style. The music is not especially pianistic; indeed, it's hard to imagine a bad performance of it. Nothing bravura, no arpeggios, no ticklish fingering problems challenge the performer. We hear, we may think, inner voices, but they all seem to be saying the same thing.

Yet these purchases can be misleading. Most were obtained with huge inputs of church money from South Korea and Japan, minimum cash downpayments and sizable mortgages.

Given the structure of most credit programs, it is surprising that default rates are not even higher. Guarantee rates are typically 100%, giving lenders little reason to screen customers carefully. Reducing those rates moderately (say, to 75%) would still provide substantial assistance to borrowers. But it would also encourage lenders to choose more creditworthy customers, and go a long way toward reducing defaults. For example, the Small Business Administration has had reasonable success in reducing both guarantee rates and default rates in its Preferred Lenders' Program.

The Conservative government's decision may reflect its desire to shed a politically sensitive issue well before the next election, expected in late 1991. “It's now a very good time politically to get this over and done with,” observed Daniel Jones, professor of motor industry management at the University of Cardiff in Wales.

Other cases go to show that an old saw still applies: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Certificates of deposit don't pay 23% a year, for example, but that didn't give pause to clients of one Alabama planner. Now they're losers and he's in jail in Mobile County. CDs yielding 40% are even more implausible - especially when the issuing “bank” in the Marshall Islands is merely a mail drop watched over by a local gas-station operator - but investors fell for that one too.

For Mr. Jones, it was just the beginning. He quickly cut the team's bloated administrative staff by half, shut down a Cowboys-owned dance academy and, in July, announced plans to sell Valley Ranch, the team's 30-acre practice camp and the most lavish training facility in the NFL. Mr. Jones calls the ranch “the Pentagon of Sportdom.” It is a maze of halls that connects film rooms, elaborate spas and weight-training centers that testify to a richer, more free-spending era. He likes to tell the yarn of how he got lost on the expansive ranch during an early visit, took refuge in an office and called the front desk for help. “I said, “Somebody come get me.

SHORT SKIRTS not welcome in Texas court: Shelly Hancock, a male county court judge in Houston, refused to let a woman plead guilty to a drunk-driving charge because her skirt stopped three inches above her knees. The woman appeared in court Thursday to enter her plea, but when she started to approach the bench, she was stopped by Judge Hancock. He told the woman's lawyer, Victor Blaine, that the short skirt was inappropriate for a court appearance. Despite Mr. Blaine's protests, the judge rescheduled her case for Nov. 27. Kelly Siegler, an assistant district attorney who was in the courtroom, disputed suggestions the action was sexist, saying she had seen Judge Hancock turn away male defendants dressed in shorts, tank tops or muscle shirts “many times.” Judge Hancock didn't return phone calls.

That's a lot of banishment, as it turns out. CFCs are the primary ingredient in a gas, often referred to by the Du Pont trade name Freon, which is compressed to liquid form to serve as the cooling agent in refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment. Gases containing CFCs are pumped into polyurethane to make the foam used in pillows, upholstery and insulation. Polyurethane foam is a highly efficient insulator, which accounts for why the walls of refrigerators and freezers can be thinner now than they were back in the days when they were insulated with glass fiber.

Companies that only recently were thriving find themselves scrambling to survive. As their varied strategies suggest, there is more than one way to respond to a disaster - though it's too soon to tell whether the changes will pay off. For many companies, the instinctive first response is to cut costs. Others are trying to find specialty defense work spared by the slowdown or new niches created by budget-cutting. More venturesome businesses are applying their skills in commercial fields.

It can be hoped that Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez will draw the right conclusion from his narrow election victory Sunday. A strong challenge from the far left, the Communist coalition Izquierda Unida, failed to topple him.

A continuing slide in the pound could force the government to push through another rise in the base rate, currently 15%. That could shove a weak economy into recession. Economists have been anticipating a slump for months, but they now say it will be deeper and longer than they had thought. Britain's economy “is developing rapidly toward no-growth,” says J. Paul Horne, international economist with Smith Barney, Harris Upham Co. in Paris.

Liquidity also appears to be far healthier than it was in 1987, when a lack of it brought the financial system close to break-down.

And Mr. Phelan, the Big Board's chairman, says that the exchange hasn't turned up any capital problems among its 49 specialist firms, suggesting that the Big Board will have the capacity to make orderly markets even if volume is heavy.

Last month, Transportation Secretary Sam Skinner forced Northwest Airlines to reduce a stake held by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. But he has since run into opposition from the Treasury and the White House over that decision. And he has kept mum on how his decision might affect a bid for United Airlines, which includes a big stake by British Airways PLC. Some analysts say uncertainty about Washington's anti-takeover policy was one reason that financing for the United Airlines takeover fell through - the event that triggered the market drop.

At best, demonstrations are overused and boringly uninformative; at worst, they can become the stimuli that lead to law breaking. Demonstrations are particularly apt to degenerate into criminal conduct when they leave the site of the grievance and become mobile. Petty criminals and street people looking for excitement attach themselves like remora to the fringes of the crowd and use the protest as an excuse for rock throwing, auto trashing, arson, window breaking, looting, pocket picking and general hooliganism. Soon the whole purpose of the demonstration is lost in mob mania. There are better ways to promote a cause.

Mr. Jones is attacking the problem on several fronts. He continues to reshuffle the team, trading famed running back Herschel Walker to the Minnesota Vikings this month for a slew of players and future draft picks. To try to draw more fans, he has dropped end-zone ticket prices from $25 to $19. But the general trend, given rising costs in the league, has been to raise prices, and Mr. Jones is expected to eventually follow suit. “It's simple,” says Lamar Hunt, who owns the Kansas City Chiefs and last year raised ticket prices by $2.40 to an average $17. “If we didn't increase prices, we'd be in the red.”

Which brings up the worst and meanest ghost of all - the ghost of the shah of Iran. When the shah died, President Carter was so scared that the shah's ghost would blame him for shoving him out to make way for the ayatollah that he declared the Carter Doctrine. Mr. Carter said he would go to war to stop anyone from trying to grab Iran. But that ghost wouldn't settle for words, he wanted money and people - lots. So Mr. Carter formed three new Army divisions and gave them to a new bureaucracy in Tampa called the Rapid Deployment Force. But that ghost wasn't fooled; he knew the RDF was neither rapid nor deployable nor a force - even though it cost $8 billion or $10 billion a year.

Mrs. Marcos's attorneys asked federal Judge John F. Keenan to give them access to all U.S. documents about her alleged abduction. The U.S. attorney's office, in documents it filed in response, said Mrs. Marcos was making the “fanciful - and factually unsupported - claim that she was kidnapped into this country” in order to obtain classified material in the case. The office also said Mrs. Marcos and her husband weren't brought to the U.S. against their will after Mr. Marcos was ousted as president. The prosecutor quoted statements from the Marcoses in which they said they were in this country at the invitation of President Reagan and that they were enjoying the hospitality of the U.S.

All this havoc is the result of one of the worst busts in Arizona's boom-and-bust history, compounded by some of the usual suspects in 1980s banking debacles: greed, fraud and plain bad banking. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, lenders and developers poured money into office buildings, condominiums and massive tracts of raw desert land, confident that Arizona's population would grow at annual rates of 4% to 6% for years to come. Now, annual population growth is running at about 2% a year, some desert tracts bought three years ago for $90,000 an acre are being sold at $25,000 an acre and Phoenix has a seven-year supply of unoccupied office space.

But as astounding as the changes that have already occurred are, there is a fragility to glasnost. Censorship isn't a Marxist invention. The czars were no civil libertarians. As late as the 1890s, the Russian government prevented any coverage of famines. It even directed newspapers not to publish anything that might stain the honor of the Turkish sultan's wives. So glasnost is not a value woven with steel threads into the fabric of Russian society.

THE UNITED AUTO WORKERS said it will seek a rehearing of a U.S. appellate court ruling against the union's claim that the state of Michigan engages in wage-discrimination against female employees. A three-judge panel of the court in Cincinnati made the ruling Saturday. The UAW is seeking a hearing by the full 14-judge panel.

The UAW also charged that the state applied its own standards for determining pay in a discriminatory manner. In November 1987, a district court judge in Detroit ruled against the UAW. The union is the bargaining representative for more than 20,000 Michigan state employees.

In the mid-June round of voting, Greeks gave no clear mandate to any single political party. The ad interim coalition government that emerged from post-electoral hagglings was, in essence, little more than the ill-conceived offspring of ideological miscegenation: On one side, the center-right New Democracy Party, headed by Constantine Mitsotakis. On the other, the so-called Coalition of the Left and Progress - a quaint and rather deceptive title for a merger of the pro-Soviet Communist Party of Greece and its Euro-Communist cousin, the Hellenic Left.

A man from the Bush administration came before the House Agriculture Committee yesterday to talk about the U.S.'s intention to send some $100 million in food aid to Poland, with more to come from the EC. The committee's members are worried what all this free food might do to the economic prospects of Poland's own farmers. Rep. Gary Ackerman noted that past food aid had harmed farmers in El Salvador and Egypt. However well intentioned, food transfers have the habit of growing larger and wrecking the market incentives for the recipient country's own farmers. The First World has for some time had the bad habit of smothering other people's economies with this kind of unfocused kindness. It should be constantly stressed that Poland's farmers mostly need a real market for their products.

An undistinguished college student who dabbled in zoology until he concluded that he couldn't stand cutting up frogs, Mr. Corry wanted to work for a big company “that could do big things.” But after joining the tax department of a USX subsidiary 30 years ago, he set the modest goal of becoming tax manager by the age of 46. For years, he quietly stuck to the back accounting rooms, wearing a hat to work because everyone else did. “I was never a rebel,” he said in an earlier interview. “I don't think most of the people that have been around me would ever say they've seen me pound the table or get angry.”

It was a heady experience for the pockmarked and slightly built Mr. Noriega, who was known to his friends as Cara la Pina - pineapple face.

Tony was four years older than most of his fellow cadets, and gained admission to the academy because his brother had falsified his birth certificate. He considered himself intellectually superior to his Peruvian peers, many of whom were wayward sons sent by their well-off families to the highly disciplined, French-modeled academy as a sort of reform school.

Our teachers are not an important factor in our educational crisis. Whether they are or are not underpaid is a problem of equity; it is not an educational problem.

Short selling isn't necessarily bad for the overall market. Shorted shares must eventually be replaced through buying. In addition, changes in short interest in some stocks may be caused by arbitrage.

The complex bill, introduced by Sens. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), Richard Lugar (R., Ind.), and Bob Kerrey (D., Neb.), covers a wide range of provisions that would affect the funding and authority of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and would profoundly change the way the industry is regulated. These include provisions relating to the technology and systems that must be employed by exchanges, oversight and disciplinary procedures for exchange trading practices, the relationship between commodity brokerage firms and floor traders, and exchange governance. The bill also elevates even minor rule infractions to felonies and provides for recovery of punitive damages in civil lawsuits and arbitration cases without any showing of willful misconduct.

Some Canadian political commentators have opposed Canada's joining what they see as a U.S.-dominated organization. “Canada could do plenty of things to get serious about Latin America without running the risk of getting caught in the cross fire” between the U.S. and Latin American members of the OAS, said Jeffrey Simpson, a columnist in Toronto's Globe & Mail newspaper.

For one thing, even with many farmers planting more winter wheat this year than last, tight wheat supplies are likely to support prices well into 1990, the analysts say. And if rain doesn't fall soon across many of the Great Plains' wheat-growing areas, yields in the crop now being planted could be reduced, further squeezing supplies. Also supporting prices are expectations that the Soviet Union will place substantial buying orders over the next few months.

In its home market, Nissan has grabbed attention with limited-production minicars featuring styling odd enough to be cute. One is the Pao, a tiny coupe with a peelback canvas top and tilted headlights that give it a droopy-eyed look. Nissan initially planned to sell just 10,000 Paos, but sales have passed 50,000, and there's a one-year waiting list for the car. Then, there's the S-Cargo, an offbeat delivery van with a snail-like body that inspired its name. Nissan helped develop a Tokyo restaurant with both vehicles as its design theme. The chairs are S-Cargo seats, and a gift shop sells such items as alarm clocks styled like the Pao's oversized speedometer.

Speculation as to the nature of aliens will no doubt continue until we wake up one morning to find they've taken over “The Today Show,” the way they overwhelm an entire town in Jack Finney's “Invasion of the Body Snatchers” (Fireside\/Simon & Schuster, 216 pages, $8.95).

The point of this 1955 novel, which spawned two movies, is that the soulless pod people replicated by alien plants are virtually indistinguishable from human folks.

Many corporate executives don't understand or don't want to understand that their own companies eventually become victims of such policies. Inflation destroys capital investment. Corporate depreciation reserves lose value relative to equipment replacement costs. Investors are reluctant to invest long term. Corporations, in effect, decapitalize themselves. That was reflected in the stagnant stock market of the 1970s. Strikes increase as workers demand raises to cope with rising prices, make up for what they already have lost and hedge against what they will lose in the months ahead. Productivity falls, and weaker production further fans inflation. The middle class gets poorer, and the poor feel greater pain than ever. All of which explains why stock and foreign exchange markets get jittery when the Fed comes under political pressure. Particularly so when it comes at a time when the Fed has done well. When it tightened up last spring, the price indexes fell and the economy began to pick up speed again, which is of course exactly counter to the “inflation-fuels-growth” theory.

COTTON: Futures prices rose modestly, but trading volume wasn't very heavy. The December contract settled at 73.97 cents a pound, up 0.59 cent, but it rose as high as 74.20 cents. Several cotton analysts said that the move appeared to be mostly technical. Traders who had sold contracts earlier, in hopes of buying them back at lower prices, yesterday were buying contracts back at higher prices to limit their losses. Floor traders also said that the market could have been helped by rumors, which have been circulating for the past two days, about China purchasing cotton. The rumor, which has been neither confirmed nor denied, has China buying 125,000 to 200,000 bales for near-term delivery. One floor trader said that if there were Chinese purchases, they should have had a bigger effect on the market. Another said that if China was a buyer, it would be the earliest that country had made purchases since the 1979-80 crop year, and thus would be a bullish sign. This trader characterized the recent price action as a contest between the fundamentalists, who see higher prices ahead, and the technicians, who are basically buying cotton toward the bottom of the current trading range, around 71 cents, and selling it when the price climbs more than 74 cents. This trader said that he thought the market would turn aggressively bullish from a technical standpoint if the December contract was able to exceed 75.75 cents. He also noted that stocks on Aug. 1, 1990, are currently projected at 3.3 million bales, the smallest end-of-season supply since 1985.

Separately, a third conference report covering an $18.4 billion Treasury and Postal Service bill was sent to the Senate after passing the House on a 383-30 roll call yesterday. And after weeks of delay, the appropriations process is beginning to take some final shape. Defense and foreign aid are the two most critical areas remaining from the administration's standpoint. And among domestic programs, the most serious threat is White House opposition to abortion riders attached to separate bills funding the District of Columbia and Department of Health and Human Services. The same issue threatens to spill over to the foreign aid debate, and Mr. Bush also is threatening to veto any agreement that preserves Senate-passed provisions renewing U.S. support for the United Nations Fund for Population Activities.

The program matches funds raised from the sale of the commercial paper with small to medium-sized leases. LDI termed the paper “non-recourse financing,” meaning that investors would be repaid from the lease receivables, rather than directly by LDI Corp.

Stadium boosters claim that without public money they would never be built. Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie disagrees, and he can prove it.

He didn't see why the taxpayers should help build something he would then use to turn a healthy profit. “This stadium shows that anything government can do, we can do better,” Mr. Robbie says.

In addition to owning HBO, with 22 million subscribers, Time Warner separately operates cable-TV system serving about 5.6 million cable-TV subscribers. Tele-Communications controls close to 12 million cable subscribers, and Viacom has about one million. In its suit against Time, Viacom says the ownership of both cable systems and cable-programming networks gives the company too much market power. Time argues that in joining up with Tele-Communications, Viacom has potentially more power, particularly since Viacom also owns cable networks MTV, VH-1 and Nick at Nite. Ironically, Tele-Communications and Time have often worked closely in the cable business. Together, they control nearly 40% of Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc.; Tele-Communications has a 21.8% stake, while Time Warner has a 17.8% stake. But since Time's merger with Warner Communications Inc., relations between the two have become strained. Each company worries that the other is becoming too powerful and too vertically integrated.

Meanwhile, more computer makers now are competing for the new business. Seiko Epson Corp., a newcomer to the industry, fought off a legal challenge and started selling NEC clones last year. It has won about 15% of the retail PC market. Sony Corp., which temporarily dropped out of the PC business three years ago, started selling its work station in 1987 and quickly became the leading Japanese company in that market.

To wit, my maiden voyage (and novitiates are referred to as virgins) began at dawn on a dew-sodden fairway and ended at noon in a soggy field. (Balloon flights almost always occur at dawn or dusk, when the winds are lightest.) In between came lots of coffee drinking while watching the balloons inflate and lots of standing around deciding who would fly in what balloon and in what order (the baskets hold no more than four passengers). When it wasn't my turn in the balloon I followed its progress from the “chase car,” listening to the driver holler into a walkie-talkie. After long stretches of this attendant ground activity came 20 or so lovely minutes of drifting above the Vosges watching the silver mists rise off the river and the French cows amble about the fields. It's hard not to feel that God's in his heaven with this kind of bird's-eye view of the world, even if your pilote in silly plaid beret kept pointing out how “belle” it all was. Eventually little French farmers and their little French farmwives came out of their stone houses and put their hands above their tiny eyes and squinted at us.

Early yesterday, bonds rose as investors rushed to buy Treasury securities on the prospect that stocks would plummet in the aftermath of the massive California earthquake. For example, some securities analysts warned that stocks of certain insurance companies, which face massive damage claims, would get hit hard.

“Barber was seated by the fireplace looking very pale,” recalls the violinist, who performed the work with a piano accompanist at the composer's apartment. “He didn't say much, but what he said was important because it's not in the score.

These two myths have caused the republic untold damage. The U.S. economy took on an inflationary bias when the Fed was forced to finance an incredible spending spree by Lyndon Johnson. Richard Nixon exacerbated the problem when, in response to pressures from Congress, he applied price and wage controls in August 1971, thereby discouraging production. Jimmy Carter ultimately hired Mr. Volcker to kill inflation, which was reaching dangerous levels. He did, too late to save Mr. Carter from forced retirement.

Whether psyllium makes Sidhpur's fortune depends on cholesterol-fearing Americans, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and, of course, the outcome of further research.

Still, Mr. Birnbaum says his relationship with Guber Peters was “one of the most successful I've had in Hollywood.” The two “have a wonderful chemistry - Jon is very impulsive, and Peter is very compulsive,” adds Mr. Birnbaum, who is now head of production at News Corp.'s 20th Century Fox Film Co. “Jon Peters will come barreling into a room, say he's got a great idea, and be gone.

A group of United's noncontract employees said in a statement, “The fact that Wolf and other officers were going to line their pockets with literally millions of dollars while instituting severe pay cuts on the nonunion employees of United is not only deplorable but inexcusable.” The machinists also asked for an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into possible securities-law violations in the original bid for UAL by Mr. Davis, as well as in the response by UAL.

The end of the first half, however, brought what the standing-room-only crowd seemed to be waiting for: the pop singer Judy Collins, who appears on “Inner Voices.” Glamorous and pure-voiced as ever, Ms. Collins sang Joni Mitchell's “For Free” - about an encounter with a street-corner clarinetist, to which Mr. Stoltzman contributed a clarinet obligatto - and Mr. Douglas's lush setting of a Gaelic blessing, “Deep Peace.” “Deep Peace” also featured a slide show of lovely but predictable images of clouds, beaches, deserts, sunsets, etc. It was all too mellow to be believed, but they probably would have gotten away with it, had they not felt compelled to add Ms. Collins's signature tune, “Amazing Grace,” and ask for audience participation. That went over the permissible line for warm and fuzzy feelings.

“Computers here are used for data gathering,” says Roger J. Boisvert, who manages the integrated-technologies group in McKinsey & Co.'s Tokyo office. Some Japanese operations, such as securities-trading rooms, may be ahead of their American counterparts, he says, but “basically, there's little analysis done on computers in Japan.” Of course, simply buying computers doesn't always solve problems, and many American companies have erred by purchasing technology they didn't understand. But healthy skepticism is only a small reason for Japan's PC lag. Various cultural and economic forces have suppressed demand.

The bond issue is TVA's first public offering since the Financing Bank was created in 1974, primarily to finance the TVA. But the offering almost didn't happen.

But it is unfair to dump on teachers, as distinct from the educational establishment. I know many schoolteachers and, on the whole, they are seriously committed to conscientious teaching. They may not be among the “best and brightest” of their generation - there are very few such people, by definition. But they need not be to do their jobs well. Yes, we all can remember one or two truly inspiring teachers from our school days. But our education proceeded at the hands of those others, who were merely competent and conscientious. In this sense, a teacher can be compared to one's family doctor. If he were brilliant, he probably would not be a family doctor in the first place. If he is competent and conscientious, he serves us well.

Because the cycle of poverty along the lower Mississippi goes back so many generations, breaking this cycle will be next to impossible. Sadly, the cycle appears not as waves but as a downward spiral.

As it went to the conference panel now deliberating, the appropriations bill for the executive office of the president for fiscal 1990 contained some breathtaking attempts by Congress to rewrite the Constitution under the pretext of protecting the public's money.

But LTV's move marks the first effort by a major steelmaker to counter the free fall in spot prices. Major steel producers are selling cold rolled sheet steel at about $370 a ton, compared with a peak price of $520 a ton in 1988. Second-tier companies are receiving even less per ton. LTV's planned increase, which was announced in an Oct. 26 memo to district managers, doesn't affect electrogalvanized steel or tin plate.

Primarily because there's more to the matter than Ronald Reagan's personal values, or lack of them. Selling the presidency for a mess of pottage is not so much a devaluation from the norm of public life today as it is a reflection of the disintegration of public standards. The theme song for the 1980s has been, “Anything Goes,” and it has been whistled with gusto from Wall Street to some of the highest peaks of televangelism.

In the case of HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan, the litmus test could yet damage issues important to other parts of the Republican coalition. After Mr. Sullivan waffled on abortion last year, the White House appeased right-to-lifers by surrounding him with pro-life deputies. Their views on health care and welfare didn't much matter, though HHS spends billions a year on both. It makes only a handful of abortion-related decisions.

Many of the adjusters employed by Aetna and other insurers have some experience with construction work or carpentry. But such skills were alien to Toni Johnson. Four years ago, she was managing a film-processing shop and was totally bored. A friend mentioned that she might want to look into a position at Aetna, if she was interested in a job that would constantly challenge her. She signed up, starting as an “inside” adjuster, who settles minor claims and does a lot of work by phone. A year later, she moved to the commercial property claims division.

Japan is not a political country. It is a bureaucratic country. The Diet plays a minor role compared with the powerful bureaucratic system. Most bills are drafted by bureaucrats, not politicians. The Diet doesn't normally even debate bills because the opposition parties are so often opposed to whatever LDP does that it would be a waste of time. So most bills are passed without full discussion; particularly difficult bills are passed in the absence of the opposition parties.

The Fed allowed the key federal funds interest rate to dip to about 8 5\/8% from its levels of just below 9% last week. That was a sign to financial markets that, at least for now, the Fed was easing its grip on credit.

There was certainly no stopping the tide of ANC emotion last night, when hundreds of people jammed into the Holy Cross Anglican Church in Soweto for what became the first ANC rally in the country in 30 years. Deafening chants of “ANC” and “Umkhonto we Sizwe” shook the church as the seven aging men vowed that the ANC would continue its fight against the government and the policies of racial segregation on all fronts, including the armed struggle. And they called on the government to release Nelson Mandela, the ANC's leading figure, who was jailed with them and remains in prison. Without him, said Mr. Sisulu, the freeing of the others “is only a half-measure.”

This year Congress, with prodding from President Bush, has been busy trying to put many of these same tax preferences back into the code.

Because of the large amounts of money being raised, the loose disclosure requirements and the casual monitoring of how the money is used, some analysts fear that there could be a few mega-crashes, which could hurt market confidence far more than the small bankruptcies that followed the boom of 1986. The government insists that such a possibility is low. It says that despite loose regulation of the market itself, its longstanding regulation of industry will prevent such crashes.

Until 1980, when Japan joined the $10,000 per capita GNP club of the advanced countries, it was a model developing nation. The government built ports, bridges, highways, schools, hospitals and railways. When industries were weak, it protected them. It gave the Japanese people a value system, based on the rationalization that given the country's lack of natural resources, they must work hard to create value through exports and buy food with the surplus. Individual prosperity inevitably would result.

While oil prices have been better than expected, natural gas prices have been worse. In the third quarter, they averaged about 5% less than they were in 1988. The main reason remains weather. Last summer was notable for a heat wave and drought that caused utilities to burn more natural gas to feed increased electrical demand from air conditioning use. This summer, on the other hand, had milder weather than usual.

Campeau's financial situation is complicated by an estimated $1.23 billion in debt due next spring. This includes a working capital facility for Allied Stores of $350 million that matures March 15, 1990, and an $800 million bridge loan due April 30, 1990. The company has stated in recently filed financial documents that it anticipates refinancing its March 1990 payments. In recent months, numerous retailers have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, including Bonwit Teller, B. Altman & Co., and Miller & Rhoads Inc. Those filings, plus the expected sale of a number of financially healthy chains, such as Saks Fifth Avenue, Marshall Field's and Bloomingdale's, have added to the anxiety.

But there is a risk, which the Japanese discovered when they first dipped their toes into the market nearly five years ago. Since most mortgages can be prepaid or refinanced at any time, issuers of mortgage securities retain the right to buy back their bonds before maturity.

On a commercial scale, the sterilization of the pollen-producing male part has only been achieved in corn and sorghum feed grains. That's because the male part, the tassel, and the female, the ear, are some distance apart on the corn plant. In a labor-intensive process, the seed companies cut off the tassels of each plant, making it male sterile. They sow a row of male-fertile plants nearby, which then pollinate the male-sterile plants. The first hybrid corn seeds produced using this mechanical approach were introduced in the 1930s and they yielded as much as 20% more corn than naturally pollinated plants. The vast majority of the U.S. corn crop now is grown from hybrid seeds produced by seed companies.

Mr. Wanniski's opportuning of the recent stock drubbing to castigate Sen. Bill Bradley for his opposition to a capital-gains tax cut contains some clever but faulty reasoning. If Mr. Wanniski's theory is right, that a tax cut increases the value of capital assets held by owners, wouldn't that increase also represent a rather dramatic and totally unjustified inflation of those values? According to his figures, asset values would be pumped up some $50 billion overnight with the passage of the cut. This is “real money,” Mr. Wanniski says. I say, real trouble.

Abortion via the pill is far more of an ordeal than conventional surgical abortion.

Their compounding effect is also alluring. In June, Virginia sold bonds for $268.98 that will pay $1,000 in 2009.

All these thoughts raced through my head in the 15 seconds of the earthquake's actual duration. The rest is, of course, history. The Stick didn't fall.

The wall behind me was slightly deformed, but the center had held. And most of us waited for a while for the game to start. Then we began to file out, to wait safely on terra firma for the opening pitch.

As followers of the debate over a capital-gains tax cut know, there is much talk in Congress and indeed all over Washington about the need to “encourage” long-term investment and discourage the financial sector's presumed obsession with the short term. Now, we regard this as a largely phony issue, but the “long term” is nonetheless a big salon topic all around the Beltway. It turns out that Columbia had this huge loss in large part because the new congressionally mandated rules forced it to adjust the book value of its soon-to-be-sold junk bonds to the lower of either their cost or market value. They could no longer be classified as what Columbia regarded them, namely long-term investments.

A U.S. decision to refuse the IMF its capital increase, or limit it to 25%, would bring a major change in international economic policy, and could not be taken lightly. Commentators would fret over the implications for the G-7 coordination process and the stability of world financial markets. Because commercial banks and the developing-country governments believe they will get a piece of any capital increase, a scaled-down IMF mission would leave both feeling shortchanged. Furthermore, a U.S. rejection of the capital increase (and transfer of shares to Japan) would give Japan an argument against future calls for economic burden-sharing.

In April 1987, evidence surfaced that commissions were paid. The opposition charged that the money was used to bribe Indian government officials, an allegation denied by Mr. Gandhi's administration. But many of his statements on the issue in Parliament subsequently were proven wrong by documentary evidence. The scandal has faded and flared, but recent disclosures propelled it back onto the front pages, and that has helped galvanize the opposition, which last week blocked passage of two constitutional amendment bills. It was the first time in 20 years that such government bills were defeated.

Nonetheless, some economists argue that Americans simply won't save unless the government gives them an immediate reward. “This instant gratification overcomes the usual bias against savings,” says John Skinner, a University of Virginia economist.

Phillips Petroleum's third-quarter earnings slid 60%, to $87 million, or 36 cents a share, from $215 million, or 89 cents a share. Revenue rose 6.9%, to $3.1 billion from $2.9 billion. Shrinking profit margins in chemical and refining and marketing sectors accounted for most of the decline, said Chairman C.J. Silas in a statement. Despite higher oil prices, exploration and production profits were off because of foreign-currency losses and some construction costs incurred in one of Phillips' North Sea oil fields. A year ago, results were buoyed by a $20 million after-tax gain from an asset sale.

During the past 25 years, the number of balloonists (those who have passed a Federal Aviation Authority lighter-than-air test) have swelled from a couple hundred to several thousand, with some estimates running as high as 10,000. Some 30 balloon shows are held annually in the U.S., including the world's largest convocation of ersatz Phineas Foggs - the nine-day Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta that attracts some 800,000 enthusiasts and more than 500 balloons, some of which are fetchingly shaped to resemble Carmen Miranda, Garfield or a 12-story-high condom.

Goldman Sachs snapped back that the WDB is not an accurate predictive tool because dollar reserves in central banks do not dictate how much money there is in the world. “The Bundesbank might be rather surprised to be told that dollar purchases and sales were their only instrument for monetary policy!” observed Goldman Sachs. “Instead, the supply of money in foreign countries can be (and is) expanded and contracted through open-market operations just as is the case in the United States. Foreign central banks buy or sell government securities to add or drain reserves from the banking system.” BMC replied, yes, but in any monetary system there is one “final asset in which all forms of credit are ultimately payable” and today that final asset is the U.S. dollar.

But the notebook, with the more advanced microprocessor and hard disk, is more innovative. Weighing 6.7 pounds with battery, the notebook measures 8.2 by 11.7 inches, has a 20-megabyte hard disk drive and boasts a backlit screen that is 22% larger than Compaq's. Its keyboard, according to industry consultants, is better than Compaq's, but its battery life of two to three hours is shorter. It doesn't have an internal floppy disk drive, although a snap-on drive can be purchased separately. Its greatest drawback may be its 3-inch thickness, big enough for one consultant to describe it as “clunky.”

The Fed, of course, knows that very well - hence its readiness to pump credit into the economy this morning. But, in the process, the Fed risks reigniting inflation. Even before Friday's events, Harvard University economist Benjamin Friedman was arguing that the Fed won't be able to live up to its tough words on eliminating inflation because of its responsibility to protect fragile financial markets, banks and highly leveraged corporations. The biggest threat on the economic horizon right now isn't recession, he reasons; it's an outbreak of uncontrolled inflation.

Moreover, much of the investment boom is in high-tech fields in which Japanese companies have only limited foreign competition; so, more investment practically assures more exports. Toshiba Corp., for example, is spending $986 million on two new plants to build four-megabit dynamic random access memories, the next generation of computer chips. The product isn't widely used yet, but Toshiba, which has already beaten everyone else in producing the current-generation one-megabit DRAMs, believes that its early investment will heighten its chances of beating its competitors again. “It's important to gain leadership,” a Toshiba spokesman says.

Mr. Cawthorn attributed the decline in third-quarter operating profit to the stronger dollar, which reduces the value of overseas profit when it is translated into dollars; to accelerated buying of Rorer products in the second quarter because of a then-pending July 1 price increase, and to higher marketing expenses for Rorer's Maalox antacid, whose sales and market share in the U.S. had slipped in the first half of 1989. He said Rorer opted to sell Asilone and Thrombinar to raise revenue that would “kick start” its increased marketing efforts behind Maalox, still its top-selling product with about $215 million in world-wide sales in 1988. “We had underfunded Maalox for a year,” he said, because the company was concentrating on research and development and promoting other drugs.

COFFEE: Futures prices rose slightly in a market filled with rumors that a new international coffee agreement might still be achieved. The December contract ended with a gain of 1.29 cents a pound at 74.35 cents. According to one analyst, prices opened higher because of reports over the weekend that Brazil and Colombia, at the Pan-American summit meeting in Costa Rica, had agreed to a reduction in their coffee export quotas for the sake of creating a new agreement. The reports, attributed to the Colombian minister of economic development, said Brazil would give up 500,000 bags of its quota and Colombia 200,000 bags, the analyst said. These reports were later denied by a high Brazilian official, who said Brazil wasn't involved in any coffee discussions on quotas, the analyst said. The Colombian minister was said to have referred to a letter that he said President Bush sent to Colombian President Virgilio Barco, and in which President Bush said it was possible to overcome obstacles to a new agreement. The minister was also quoted as saying that a new pact could be achieved during the first half of next year, according to the analyst.

Taming the union complements previous moves by the government to attract private investment in petrochemicals, which Mexico has been forced to import in large quantities in recent years.

Having rejected central economic planning for economic reasons, and the market for fear of the social (political) consequences, Mr. Gorbachev seeks a “third way” that would combine the discipline and controls of the former with the economic benefits of the latter. Most important, this would leave the party intact and its monopoly of political power largely undisturbed. Indeed, Mr. Gorbachev's proposals display a close conceptual resemblance to the tenets of Italian fascism, whose architects spoke specifically of a “third way”: of having produced a historic synthesis of socialism and capitalism. They, too, promised to combine economic efficiency with order and discipline.

As a model of capitalist efficiency on southern China's doorstep, Hong Kong's prospects look good. China's land and labor offer inexpensive alternatives to local industry. China-bound freight streams through the territory's port. In the decade since the communist nation emerged from isolation, its burgeoning trade with the West has lifted Hong Kong's status as a regional business center. These benefits seem secure despite China's current economic and political troubles. But to Hong Kong, China isn't purely business. It is also the sovereign power that, come 1997, will take over this British colony. China's leaders have promised generous liberties for post-1997 Hong Kong. That promise sounds shaky now that those same leaders have fallen back on Marxist dogma and brute force to crush their nation's democracy movement.

Maybe, maybe not. Abby Joseph Cohen, a market strategist at Drexel Burnham Lambert, isn't nearly so sanguine about the market's chances of surging to new highs anytime soon. Her view is that stock prices have three major props: merger and buy-out proposals, earnings and the economic outlook. At current levels of economic activity and earnings, stocks are fairly valued, she says. But any chance for prices to surge above fair value lies in the speculation that accompanies a vigorous merger and buy-out business, and UAL has obviously put a damper on that. “Stocks aren't cheap anymore, there have been some judicial and legislative changes in the merger area and all of this changes the arithmetic of deals,” she says. “I'm not saying they've stopped altogether, but future deals are going to be structured differently and bids probably won't be as high.”

The now-standard price of $1 a share came about by accident. An early fund had filed a registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission that included a fixed $1 price. It arrived just as the regulator handling such operations was retiring. His successor approved the $1 price in the process of clearing the backed-up papers on his desk. When Dreyfus started the first advertising-backed retail fund in February 1974, it was priced at $10 a share (and reached $1 billion in assets in one year.) Dreyfus moved to the $1 price after the SEC set standards - an average 120-day maturity of high-grade paper - that are still the rule.

Three Soviet government officials - the ministers of railroads, of foreign economic relations and of heavy-machine building - will visit Tehran next month for talks, Iran's official news agency reported. Under an agreement signed last June, the Soviets will help Iran in oil exploration and other areas in return for exports of Iranian natural gas. And in Paris, Mahmoud Vaezi, Iran's vice minister of foreign affairs, began a five-day visit to discuss such matters as compensation to French enterprises for contracts broken by the Khomeini regime.

When they found it last winter, Dr. Vogelstein was dubious that the search was over. His doubts stemmed from the fact that several years earlier a Princeton University researcher, Arnold Levine, had found in experiments with mice that a gene called p53 could transform normal cells into cancerous ones. The deletion Dr. Vogelstein found was in exactly the same spot as p53. But Mr. Levine had said the p53 gene caused cancer by promoting growth, whereas the Johns Hopkins scientists were looking for a gene that suppressed growth.

Yesterday's floor action came as a House-Senate conference approved a nearly $8.5 billion fiscal 1990 military construction bill, representing a 5% reduction from last year and making severe cuts from Pentagon requests for installations abroad. An estimated $25.8 million is allocated to continue work in Oman. But all funding is cut for the Philippines, and projects in South Korea are cut to $13.6 million, or less than a sixth of the administration's request.
